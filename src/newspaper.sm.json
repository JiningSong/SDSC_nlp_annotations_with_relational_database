    "news": "If you ask City Manager T.C. Broadnax or Police Chief U. Renee Hall about crime in Dallas, they’ll tell you that major crimes are down. But as we peruse the city’s own database two deadly crimes stand out: weapons and drugs.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Dallas Police Department’s weekly report to City Council members, weapons violations citywide are up 69 percent so far this year. Drug and narcotics offenses are up 57 percent.\n\nWhat brought these statistics onto our radar was the arrest Saturday of Rene Eduardo Montanez Jr. on a capital murder charge in the death of Joseph Anthony Pintucci, an 18-year-old former Highland Park High School student. Police describe the incident as a drug deal gone bad in a parking garage. Pintucci’s death has drawn a great deal of attention, but a quick review of this newspaper’s files reveal many other such drug-related acts of violence.\n\nHere are the details as we know them about Pintucci’s shooting last week at the Shops at Park Lane. Police said he had used a social media app to arrange a drug sale, according to an arrest-warrant affidavit. He was in his car with two other people when Montanez and two men pulled guns and stole the drugs from him, according to the affidavit. One of the men shot Pintucci, who later died, as the trio fled on foot, the affidavit says."

    "news": "The longest government shutdown in our country’s history has ended, at least temporarily. Over the next three weeks, lawmakers must reach principled agreement to fund the entire federal government and keep it open.\n\nUnfortunately, this sad episode is a warning sign of equally difficult circumstances ahead in the new Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi appear to have irreconcilable differences. As a result of their intransigence, dedicated civil servants were furloughed or required to work without pay for more than a month. In addition, the strongest democratic country in the world has suffered a black eye to its global credibility.\n\nAs the staff director of the Senate Budget Committee during the 1995-96 government shutdown — the longest, prior to this one — I remember only too well how it ended: Republicans gave in to President Bill Clinton and abandoned their goal of enacting a plan to balance the federal budget over a seven-year period. The irony that the current shutdown relates to spending more money, with a nearly trillion-dollar deficit expected this year, is not lost on some of us.\n\nEven though Republicans conceded to the president in 1996, they were able to successfully negotiate in the following months the most fundamental reforms to our welfare system in decades. Equally important, Republicans and Democrats came together the following year — without shutting down the government — to enact the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that led to federal budget surpluses for four straight years until the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe latest shutdown has been a lesson in how each side needs something to claim victory. But that has always been the backbone of a successful negotiation, and in this instance, both congressional leaders have spent plenty of time in their careers around a negotiating table to know that. In other words, they know better.\n\nSo what will follow a shutdown that has marked such a contentious period between Republicans and Democrats?\n\nWill a divided 116th Congress and a determined president return to addressing the issues of most concern to the American public: prescription drug prices; economic, retirement, and job security; fixing the country’s infrastructure; the cost of higher education; and just maybe, the increasing imbalance between revenue and spending? One can only hope for a return to a functioning democratic, deliberative process addressing these and other pressing issues.\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nBut the unfortunate truth is that the end of the longest shutdown in our history may only be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what lies ahead.\n\nCongress must again turn to its most fundamental responsibility of adopting a budget blueprint to guide its spending and revenue decisions for next year. The president has the first shot at this blueprint and is required to submit his budget to Congress for fiscal 2020 by Feb. 4. If that submission is delayed, it would once again jeopardize Congress’ ability to complete its annual appropriation bills by the end of September.\n\nThe reinstatement of the currently suspended statutory debt limit after March 1 could trigger a real “fiscal cliff” — probably even more serious than the recent government shutdown. Past administrations have used authorized special procedures to stretch out the country’s borrowing authority beyond the statutory suspension date.\n\nBut the president, possibly thwarted by not achieving his border wall in this shutdown, could look again for leverage with Congress by not implementing these extraordinary measures and holding hostage the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. That would set off a disastrous, unprecedented government default on March 2.\n\nFinally, the statutory caps for fiscal 2020 defense and nondefense appropriations fall back from their current 2019 levels by more than $125 billion. On Oct. 1, defense spending would decline $71 billion and nondefense by $54 billion. A similar cliffhanger in 2018 resulted in the caps being adjusted upward. How will the 116th Congress choose to modify these caps for their upcoming appropriations?\n\nThis shutdown has ended, for now. But do not assume we won’t see reruns of this horror show unless, as James Madison understood at our founding, politicians compromise because they have to, not because they want to.\n\nG. William Hoagland is a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center is a D.C.-based think tank that actively promotes bipartisanship. BPC works to address the key challenges facing the nation through policy solutions that are the product of informed deliberations by former elected and appointed officials, business and labor leaders, and academics and advocates from both ends of the political spectrum.

    "news": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - Antroinette Worsham’s oldest daughter, Antavia, died of diabetes complications after she turned 21 and was no longer eligible for an Ohio Department of Health program that subsidized the cost of the insulin she needed to survive, which cost $333 per month.\n\nWearing a red “Patients over Profit$” T-shirt, the Cincinnati mom on Tuesday implored the House Oversight and Reform Committee to crack down on pharmaceutical price gouging before the same thing happens to her 18-year-old daughter, Antanique, who also has diabetes. She fears that her second daughter won’t be able to afford her insulin on top of the high cost of her college tuition, room and board.\n\n“We want to save more lives,” Worsham told a committee hearing on soaring prescription drug prices. ”It can be done. And you are the people to make it happen. I am just the voice for people.”\n\nAccording to an analysis by AARP, approximately 94 percent of widely used brand-name drugs more than doubled in price between 2005 and 2017. The organization said prescription drug costs rose an average of 8.4 percent in 2017—four times the rate of inflation. The American Diabetes Association says the average cost of insulin – which more than 7 million require to stay alive – has nearly tripled since 2002.\n\nThe chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings, has asked 12 major drug makers to give his committee information on their price increases, research investments and strategies to preserve market share and pricing power. He said he hopes his investigation will determine why drug companies are increasing prices so dramatically, how they’re using the proceeds, and how to reduce prices.\n\n“I am going to paint Ms. Worsham’s face in the DNA of every cell of my brain to try to make sure that her other daughter who is facing the same thing does not die,” Cummings said.\n\nHolmes County GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs said he wanted to make sure any changes don’t overregulate or reduce incentives for drug development.\n\nThe committee’s top Republican, Champaign County Rep. Jim Jordan, said he was concerned that Cummings launched the investigation without consulting him and that it was done “to score political points” instead of get answers. He described “Democrats` last idea for fixing health care, Obamacare,” as a “disaster we will be repairing for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nNonetheless, he said prescription drug prices are an important issue, and he expressed hope work would proceed on a bipartisan basis.\n\n“We will never succeed in delivering reforms to the American people if all possible solutions are not on the table,” said Jordan.\n\nMedical experts at the House hearing said drug companies keep drug prices high by keeping generic competitors out of the market and trying to extend their patents on medications by making slight tweaks to their composition.\n\nThey said insulin prices might be brought down if the government or nonprofit drug companies could produce old formulations of the drug that works for many patients.\n\n“This is such a widespread problem,” said Harvard Medical School Professor Aaron S. Kesselheim.\n\nThe high price of insulin and other drugs was also the focus of a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday. Its chairman, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, vowed to “get to the bottom of the insulin price problem,” and said he’s heard from seniors who have seen their prescription drug costs increase every month “for no apparent reason.”\n\n“We need to continue to have a strong research engine to develop new treatments, but we must also have a discussion about the affordability of these drugs,” said Grassley.\n\n."

    "news": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Eleven people, led by a Brazilian man, participated in an operation that mailed pieces of paper infused with synthetic opioids and other drugs to inmates in federal prisons across the country, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Cleveland said Tuesday.\n\nThe organization, which operated from 2015 to last year, used a chemical process to soak the paper in drugs obtained from China, according to a grand jury indictment. The paper was designed to be cut into strips and smoked.\n\nIn order to avoid detection, members disguised the paper as legitimate correspondence, such as letters from attorneys, funeral announcements and books, according to the 19-count indictment and an affidavit unsealed Tuesday. The organization used gangs, including the Latin Folks and G27, to deal the drugs in prison, the affidavit states.\n\nExactly how many inmates received the drug-infused papers was unclear. The affidavit, sworn out in March by FBI agent H. Douglas Williams, said authorities estimated more than 145 inmates in more than 50 federal prisons across the country were co-conspirators. That does not include other inmates the co-conspirators dealt to in prison, the affidavit says.\n\nMembers of the organization laundered the proceeds of their business, the indictment states.\n\nThe FBI says it was all led by Roy Kahn, a 48-year-old who was born in Brazil, once lived in Florida and is believed to have returned to his native country.\n\nMost of the defendants live outside Ohio, and six of them are currently in federal prison, prosecutors say. However, the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office in Cleveland took the lead on the investigation following a discovery when arresting Euclid man Irwin Vargas in a separate drug case.\n\nKahn has been wanted since March 30 on an arrest warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge. The criminal complaint and Williams` affidavit were sealed until Tuesday, when the grand jury handed up its indictment.\n\nThe indictment says Kahn and co-defendant Christopher Adams devised the process to infuse paper with drugs. At the height of their operation, they infused more than two pounds of drugs a week, resulting in at least 500 pieces of paper at a time.\n\nThe letters they sent to inmates included the names of real and fake attorneys. For the fake ones, members created websites to make the letters and names appear legitimate, prosecutors said.\n\nThe group also disguised the drugs in photographs, books and pamphlets, including Harry Potter-themed coloring books with the illicit parchment, according to prosecutors.\n\nInmates paid Kahn, Vargas and others through the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ payment system, money orders, wire transfers and mailed cash, prosecutors claim. They charged at least $500 for a sheet of paper, authorities say.\n\nIn addition to laundering the money, Kahn also bought more Chinese drugs and had them shipped all over the country, including Cleveland, the U.S. Attorney’s Office says.\n\nThe case against Kahn, Vargas and others expanded following Vargas’ arrest in December 2017 as part of a large-scale drug bust that resulted in charges against 26 people.\n\nAuthorities said Vargas and Isidoro Gonzalez ran a drug ring where the group obtained heroin, fentanyl, cocaine and the synthetic opioid U-47700 from Puerto Rico and sold the drugs throughout Cleveland and Toledo. The groups laundered money through car repair shops, wire transfers and by depositing small amounts of money into ATMS, court records show.\n\nTuesday’s indictment says federal agents found a partial drug ledger belonging to Vargas that contained the names of inmates to whom Kahn’s organization sold drug-infused papers on Dec. 7, 2017, the same day he was arrested.\n\nVargas, who owned Santiago Autocare Services on Bridge Road in Cleveland, pleaded guilty last week to federal drug charges stemming from the 2017 case.\n\nHis attorney David Grant said Tuesday afternoon that he had not yet seen the new indictment.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story, please visit Tuesday’s crime and courts comments section."

Sherrod Brown launches his tour of early presidential primary states Wednesday during a rally in Northeast Ohio before heading to Iowa. As cleveland.com’s Seth Richardson writes, Brown’s chances at winning the nomination in a crowded field hinge on his performance in the Hawkeye State.\n\nFarm harm? Brown could have a tough time selling his position on trade in Iowa, writes Jack Torry for the Columbus Dispatch. Torry quotes David Swenson, an economics professor from Iowa State University: “Iowa grows more soybeans than any other state. At least on agricultural commodities, we seem to be getting hit [by tariffs] the worst. I don’t know how Sherrod sells this message when he comes to Iowa.”\n\nYeah but: There is a 99.9 percent chance Brown, while in Iowa, at some point will mention growing up milking cows on his family’s farm near Mansfield.\n\nOn appeal: A three-judge federal appellate panel in Cincinnati is expected to hear arguments Wednesday on Ohio’s Down syndrome abortion ban. Cleveland.com’s Laura Hancock writes that the state is appealing the case, because a lower-court judge blocked the law from going into effect.\n\nObstacles eliminated? With Gov. Mike DeWine and Ohio Right to Life backing a so-called abortion “heartbeat” bill, a measure could potentially get passed soon and end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hancock writes. Abortion supporters warn overturning Roe v. Wade could hurt women, doctors and others.\n\nRunning out the clock: A federal lawsuit aimed at redrawing Ohio’s politically gerrymandered congressional district map in time for the 2020 election faces a potential new hurdle - timing, reports cleveland.com’s Rich Exner. The Ohio Attorney General’s office this week asked the court to delay the March 4 start of the trial until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules later this year on gerrymandering cases from North Carolina and Maryland. Such a delay would “severely jeopardize” efforts to put a more fairly drawn map in place for next year’s election, even if the suit is successful, said Freda Levenson, lead attorney in the case for the ACLU of Ohio.\n\nEven more 2020 news: State Rep. Niraj Antani is expected to announce his candidacy for term-limited state Sen. Peggy Lehner’s seat in 2020. Antani, a Dayton-area Republican, said Tuesday he plans to announce a run for “higher office” today. Both Antani and fellow Republican state Rep. Jim Butler have been eyeing Lehner’s seat for awhile now.\n\nTech travails: Glitches in the state’s new online portal for filing business taxes are causing headaches for some Ohio cities, writes Randy Ludlow for the Columbus Dispatch. The problems led to late-arriving payments in some instances and in others, tax payments that are less than what are actually owed. “Just about every municipality has experienced the same problems. They are kind of universal,” said Kent Scarrett, executive director of the Ohio Municipal League.\n\nMake it stop: After introducing legislation in every Congress since 2011 that would end government shutdowns, Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman thinks the recently ended 35-day shutdown has generated enough consensus on the issue to pass his bill, cleveland.com’s Sabrina Eaton reports. He says he hopes it will be included in the deal that’s negotiated to fund the government for the rest of 2019 and make border security improvements. “Finally, there is a sense that we are tired of this and we want to see something different,” Portman said.\n\nA mother’s plea: An Ohio mom on Tuesday urged the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to reduce prescription drug costs. Antroinette Worsham of Cincinnati described how her daughter died of diabetes complications because she couldn’t afford the insulin needed to stay alive, and said she feared the same fate for a younger daughter. “We want to save more lives,” Worsham told the committee, which, Eaton reports, is examining ways to cut drug costs.\n\nA comeback? Don Plusquellic, the former longtime mayor of Akron, is considering running again for his old job, write Betty Lin-Fisher and Doug Livingston for the Akron Beacon Journal. Plusquellic, first elected Akron’s mayor in 1987, unexpectedly resigned from the position in 2015. Current Mayor Dan Horrigan didn’t mince words when asked about the possible challenge, saying in part that Plusquellic’s “bitterness and stale, personal feuds” with myriad actors \"unfortunately poisoned his ability to lead the city into its a new chapter of growth and prosperity.”\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nHere are 5 things we learned from the March 21, 2018 financial disclosure of state Sen. Cecil Thomas, a Cincinnati Democrat:\n\n1. Besides his $69,137 legislative salary, he disclosed making $25,000 to $49,999 from a pair of rental properties, as well as $25,000 to $49,999 from the pension he receives as a retired police officer.\n\n2. He has no personal investments, other than his police and state pensions.\n\n3. At some point during 2017, he owed at least $1,000 to Wells Fargo Mortgage, Fidelity Mortgage, the Cincinnati Police Federal Credit Union, American Express, Great Lakes Borrowers, Home Depot Credit, Synchrony Bank, Visa Credit Card and the Cincinnati Federal Credit Union.\n\n4. He received $4,434.56 in Senate travel reimbursements.\n\n5. The University of Cincinnati gave him two free tickets and food — and access to the university’s presidential suite — worth $120 to watch the Jan. 29, 2017 University of Cincinnati basketball game against the University of Florida.\n\nOn The Move\n\nRep. Emilia Sykes, the Ohio House Democrats’ leader, and Rep.

    "news": "College senior Jasmine Bigham can almost taste graduation. Like most students at Humboldt State University, nestled in the shade of the California Redwoods, finals are coming, and she`s studying hard. But it`s her life outside her college classroom that may be the toughest test of all. \"The hardest thing was just not being able to find housing, and so that was, like, the big issue that stood in my way,\" Bigham said.\n\n\"So, what did you do?\" asked correspondent Lee Cowan.\n\n\"I lived in my car, and then I kind of couched surfed. After that I moved into this big trailer, and then the trailer roof collapsed a little bit!\"\n\nJasmine Bigham and her home, in a parking lot at Humboldt State University. CBS News\n\nAll of that makes the van she now lives in seem not so bad. She lives in a parking lot not far from the library.\n\nBeing homeless isn`t something you`d expect from a student on a Ford Family Foundation scholarship, but even that money wasn`t enough to help with the high cost of housing near campus.\n\n\"There was some emotional points, you know, where I just was like crying `cause it was hard,\" She said. \"It`s how I think about things – I put myself here, so I had to deal with it.\"\n\n\"But you put yourself here for a good reason, though, to get through school,\" said Cowan.\n\n\"Yeah, for sure. Yeah, there is a goal at the end of the tunnel, I guess.\"\n\nJasmine Bigham lived in a van while attending Humboldt State University in California. CBS News\n\nEvery morning she makes her way to a women`s locker room on campus. There, she brushes her teeth, showers, and then heads off to class. Later, it`s back to the van.\n\nCowan asked, \"What is it that`s so important for you to go to school and get your degree that you`d put yourself through all of this?\"\n\n\"I`m gonna go become something,\" she replied. \"And I`m gonna succeed in it and keep trying, you know? If things are hard, you just gotta keep trying.\"\n\nThe number of homeless college students struggling just like Bigham is hard to quantify, but it`s big. According to financial aid applications, there are more than 68,000 students who claim to be homeless.\n\n\"I think the idea that hard-working, talented people who are trying to get an education are being derailed by homelessness, is a crisis,\" said Sara Goldrick-Rab, the leading national researcher on the problem. She`s a professor of higher education policy at Temple University in Philadelphia, and the founder of the Hope Center.\n\n\"One of the things that`s changed in the United States over time is that, if you grew up without money, we have sent a pretty strong signal to those students that financial aid is available, and you should try college, because it`s your route out of poverty,\" Goldrick-Rab said.\n\nCowan said, \"So, part of the problem is that people who weren`t going to college before …\"\n\n\"Go to college now. It`s hard to view that as a problem. I`d say the problem is that they`re going to college but we didn`t build the support for them.\"\n\nUnlike elementary and secondary school students, whose families can get some support from things like federal free breakfast and lunch programs, for college students much of that assistance dries up.\n\nGoldrick-Rab says whenever she tells people about the problem of homeless students, they seem surprised and shocked: \"It`s been hidden. I think a lot of people didn`t talk about it. I also think that most people just think about tuition; they don`t think about living [expenses].\"\n\nSome of those struggling with housing responded to a recent survey that Goldrick-Rab conducted. It was the largest of its kind ever done, involving more than 43,000 students at 66 institutions. The result: Nearly one in ten college students said they were homeless in the last year, meaning they had at least one night where they didn`t know where they were going to sleep.\n\n\"I tend to think the people who are struggling the most are not taking our surveys,\" said Goldrick-Rab, \"and that`s the part that scares me.\"\n\n\"That you don`t know how deep the problem really is?\"\n\n\"That the problem is actually a lot worse.\"\n\nColleges generally don`t like to talk about homelessness, she said, and neither do most students.\n\nDom Coronel is a 22-year-old undergraduate at DePaul University in Chicago. He told Cowan he did not want anyone to look at him differently, and so kept being homeless to himself.\n\n\"There`s that underlying feeling of just shame, that feeling of loneliness,\" he said.\n\nCoronel is studying political science with the hopes of one day going to law school. \"My dad never went to college, my mom never went to college,\" he said. \"I`d be the first person. I knew I had to do it.\"\n\nCoronel`s parents have been out of the picture since childhood – his mom has struggled with addiction, and his dad has been in and out of prison.\n\nMoney for his tuition comes from a patchwork of funding – scholarships, student loans, and some financial aid. He stretched all of that as far as he could, but last spring he found himself living in a shelter outside of town. He told Cowan, \"Sometimes you don`t make it to the shelter in time because you have to be there at a certain time to get in. Sometimes I had to sleep in parks or forests.\"\n\n\"How often would you go hungry?\"\n\n\"Like, two days without really eating a meal. I hate to say it, but I`ve eaten out of the trash before. When you`re just trying to survive, you`ll do whatever it takes.\"\n\nHe had to sneak onto a commuter train just to get to class most days, and one day it almost became too much to bear. \"As passionate as I was about my classes, and about the things I was learning about, it just got too hard to be homeless,\" Coronel said. \"I remember I was standing on the platform of the L train, and honestly I thought about jumping, and just giving up.\"\n\nCowan asked, \"What kept you from jumping?\"\n\n\"I think it was knowing very well that there are a lot more kids like me,\" he replied.\n\nDom Coronel, a student at DePaul University in Chicago, would sometimes sleep on the streets if he couldn`t get into a shelter. CBS News\n\nDepaul USA, a national homeless charity, has seen the problem all across the country, and in Chicago started a homeless housing program called Dax designed just for students.\n\nIt leased a house where it could offer at least a half-dozen students a low-cost place to stay, as long as they keep up their grades and do chores around the house.\n\nDirector Abe Morris said, \"A lot of these students either had a place to call home and lost it, or never had a place to call home, ever.\"\n\nMorris has never forgotten the day Dom Coronel came asking for help: \"He came into my office and I said, `Hey, have you eaten today?` He said, `No.` I said, `Let`s go get lunch.` And in the middle of lunch he stops eating. He said, `Abe, I`m sorry, I can`t eat no more, because I don`t eat that often, my stomach has shrunk, and I can`t eat that much food.`\n\n\"And at that point it hit me, like, Oh my gosh, this guy needs some place to go NOW.\"\n\nSo, Morris converted an office into one more bedroom, an act that very likely saved Coronel`s life. \"It`s still surreal to me,\" the young man said. \"I still wake up sometimes and it`s like, Whoa, I`m here!\"\n\n\"Even now, still?\" asked Cowan.\n\n\"Yeah, even now. I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. Like, I can concentrate on my classes. I made it on the Dean`s List. I had never done so well during a college quarter.\"\n\n\"But you never had this stability before.\"\n\n\"It`s all I needed.\"\n\nAn office at Dax House was converted into a bedroom for college student Dom Coronel. CBS News\n\nHomelessness is indiscriminate. It can effect anyone, anywhere. Sara Goldrick-Rab has found students struggling all across the country, from big universities to rural colleges. \"There are middle class people going through these problems and they`re going through them for the very first time in college,\" she said. \"Most people don`t realize the research on homelessness indicates that one of the guiding factors contributing to homelessness is just bad luck.\"\n\nLuck isn`t something most educators can spot, even if they see these struggling students every day.\n\nKathryn Jeffery, president of Santa Monica College in Los Angeles, told Cowan, \"I remember walking across campus one day and a young man walked up to me and he says, `Are you the college president?` And I said, `Yes, I am.` And he says, `Well, I wanna talk to you because I live under a freeway.`\n\n\"And he ended by saying, `And I want you to know that there are other students on campus just like me.`\"\n\nSanta Monica College doesn`t offer housing, but the school has tried to address students who are going hungry by offering food pantries. \"We have a variety of canned beans and ravioli, and of course peanut butter – all the college staples!\" Jeffery said.\n\nWhile helpful, they`re not the healthiest options, so students worked with administrators to organize a farmers market, where fresh fruits and vegetables are handed out each week, no questions asked.\n\nBut perhaps the most innovative idea came from UCLA students who, with the help of donations and grants, set up the Students 4 Students Shelter in a Santa Monica church. It`s completely run by more than 80 student volunteers like Jordan Vega.\n\nPreparing meals at the Students 4 Students Shelter in Santa Monica. CBS News\n\n\"We have four student volunteers from UCLA who are on-site every day,\" Vega said. \"We cook dinner for the residents. We eat together. We really bond with each other … It`s a community.\"\n\nMaritza Lopez knows she was lucky to get in. There`s a waiting list of at least 100 students.\n\nShe`s studying Art History at nearby Santa Monica College, and shares a small room with nine other homeless students. As small as it is, it`s coed.\n\nCowan asked, \"So, you don`t have a lot of privacy here though, do you?\"\n\n\"I think it`s pretty private,\" Lopez replied. \"I can`t really ask for too much, `cause I`m already, I`ve been given a lot.\"\n\nBetween the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., a shelter run by students is available in a Santa Monica church. CBS News\n\nBecause the students who run it also have to go to class, the shelter has to empty out from 7:00 in the morning all the way until 7:00 at night.\n\nUsually Lopez passes that time by studying on campus. \"I always kind of say, `Hey, let me think about today and tomorrow. How am I gonna survive? Like, what can I do today? What can I do tomorrow?\"\n\n\"So, where does all that optimism come from?\" Cowan asked.\n\n\"I don`t know! I got a little soul in here, right?\" she laughed.\n\n\"You`ve got a big soul, I think!\" Cowan replied.\n\nThis past June, Lopez got her associates degree, graduating with honors: \"It`s good,\" she said. \"It`s not high honors, but...\"\n\nMaritza Lopez received her associates degree from Santa Monica College. Maritza Lopez\n\n\"You say that like you`re shy about it. That`s fantastic!\" Cowan said.\n\n\"It hurts though, like, knowing that, what if I did have a place to live? I could have done way better than what I`m doing now.\"\n\nLopez is now out of that shelter, and she`s working on her Bachelor`s at her dream school, UCLA, which is covering her tuition.\n\nIt was the volunteers at the Students 4 Students shelter who helped hook her up with cheap housing near campus.\n\nAs for Jasmine Bigham, she and her van have finally left that parking lot. Last month, she graduated from Humboldt State with a degree in kinesiology, with hopes of becoming either a teacher or an athletic trainer.\n\nWe will likely never know just how many homeless students start college but have to leave without their degrees, an elusive statistic Dom Coronel says is actually a loss for everyone.\n\n\"We don`t wanna be looked at, `Oh, there goes that homeless college kid,`\" he said. \"We are future lawyers. We`re future doctors and future politicians and nurses and teachers. We may be homeless, but we`re a lot more than that, too.\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Deirdre Cohen."

    "news": "When John Kane was approaching 50, he noticed his weight had crept up to 275 pounds. At 6-foot-2 and medically obese, he turned to the gym to slim down, doing an aerobic workout five days per week.\n\nBut the regular gym sessions became tiresome after a few years, and when Kane stopped exercising, he gained back all the weight. That’s when he decided to experiment with something else: fasting.\n\nKane’s fasts have evolved over the past year and a half, but for a while, he was eating only one meal a day six days per week, and abstaining from food altogether every Friday. A couple of weeks ago, he decided to try “alternate day fasting” — eating whatever he wants every other day, and nothing in between.\n\nJoin the Vox Video Lab Go behind the scenes. Chat with creators. Support Vox video. Become a member of the Vox Video Lab on YouTube today. (Heads up: You might be asked to sign in to Google first.)\n\nWithin seven months of his fasting experiment, the Madison, Wisconsin, bus driver lost 30 pounds, or more than 10 percent of his bodyweight, reaching his lowest weight in 15 years.\n\nFasting, he says, makes him feel not just lighter but also brighter, sharper, and happier. “It wakes you up and perks you up,” Kane told me. It’s also easier for him than going to the gym or counting calories: “The most appealing thing about it is the fact I don’t have to do any kind of meal planning. I just don’t eat.”\n\nI recently got in touch with Kane, a reader who’d emailed me in the past, to hear about his experience with fasting because I’ve been noticing the buzz growing louder lately. Famous enthusiasts include reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian, musician Moby, and model Molly Sims. Actor Chris Pratt has been Instagramming about his Bible-based fast. In the media world, New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman and MSNBC host Chris Hayes have mentioned their fasting routines. Over the past couple of decades, as dozens of diets and weight management schemes have come in and out of fashion, fasting has steadily gained popularity.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s a growing scientific literature on the subject — exploring whether different types of caloric restriction can burn fat, stave off and reverse disease, and even help you live longer.\n\nAs it turns out, the science behind these diets is still pretty nascent and exploratory — more than the acolytes might have you believe. While there’s lots of animal research, human studies on fasting are only just beginning to ramp up. And while we have learned that fasting helps people lose weight, it’s only if you can stick with it. But that doesn’t make fasting any less fascinating. Here’s what we know and don’t know.\n\nNot all fasting diets are equal\n\nFirst, let’s be clear on what we’re talking about when we talk about fasting. There are a number of different types of fasts, many of which are nicely outlined in this review article and this one.\n\nGenerally, fasting involves eating no or very little food and caloric beverages for periods ranging from 12 hours to three weeks. These fasts can take on a number of forms. Here are a few types that are popular now:\n\nIntermittent fasts involve eating no food or massively cutting back on calorie intake (e.g., 500 calories per day) only intermittently (like the very popular 5:2 diet). Time-restricted feeding involves consuming calories only for a four- to six-hour window each day (for instance, skipping breakfast and only eating lunch and an early supper). Periodic fasts, the most extreme, typically last several days or longer. These diets involve drinking only calorie-free fluids or very few calories for long stretches to get the body into full fasting mode (instead of switching back and forth between fasts and feeding). Fasting-mimicking diet, a plant-based diet that involves eating very few calories — through light foods like soups, energy bars, and energy drinks — for several days each month. Researchers who study fasting developed this diet because it gets people into a fasting state but doesn’t compromise their body’s access to nutrients.\n\nOften, the major argument for periodic caloric restriction is that we did not evolve to eat three meals a day, every day. Some fasting proponents argue that our bodies were designed to be able to run on little or no food for as long as several weeks or even months. After all, we didn’t have access to a steady food supply until the advent of agriculture, and it wasn’t until the neolithic revolution that humans adopted a more regular meal pattern.\n\n“Cycles of fasting can reset and rejuvenate the human body,” said Valter Longo, director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California. Periods with no food, he said, help the body eliminate and replace damaged cells with new ones through a process called autophagy (the study of which recently garnered a Nobel Prize). (Longo is a leading fasting researcher but he’s pretty dug in — with a book about fasting, and a company that sells fasting products. He says he donates all the proceeds from the company and the book to health charities.)\n\nFasting proponents will also note that there’s a long tradition of religious fasting, though the focus there tends to be more spiritual than health-oriented. “Many religious groups incorporate periods of fasting into their rituals,” this article points out, “including Muslims who fast from dawn until dusk during the month of Ramadan, and Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and Hindus who traditionally fast on designated days of the week or calendar year.”\n\nMuch of the science on fasting focuses on disease prevention and longevity, not weight loss\n\nBut here’s something important to note about what we know from science about fasting: Though a lot of the popular interest is in weight loss, many of the key researchers who study fasting aren’t focusing on that at all. In fact, many of the studies on fasting come from institutes of aging, like this one, and the researchers behind the studies actually focus on longevity and disease prevention.\n\nResearchers have known for decades that when you restrict the food intake of lab rats — and many other species including mice, hamsters, and even yeast — you can extend their life span. In humans, fasting seems to enhance the ability to counteract the disease process.\n\n”A lot of organs start shrinking [during a periodic fast],” Longo explained. “A lot of cells start dying and we have evidence a lot of the cells killed by this process are the bad cells. Then the stem cells get turned on, and we see the body starts regenerating itself.” What’s more, he added, certain inflammatory markers and biomarkers for cancer seem to be lowered when animals and humans fast.\n\nIn 2017, Longo was a co-author on the first human trial of whether fasting might reduce the risk factors for diseases like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The researchers randomized 100 people into one of two groups for three months: The first group ate anything they wanted, and the second fasted for five consecutive days each month. (By “fasted” here, I mean, they followed the fasting-mimicking diet.) After three months, the first group was crossed over into the fasting group, so the researchers could gather even more data on fasting.\n\nThe findings were clear: Fasting just five days per month improved people’s health outcomes. The group that fasted lost weight (about 7 pounds on average), lost some body fat, lowered their blood pressure, and decreased their IGF-1, a genetic marker for diseases such as cancer. (Their total cholesterol, blood glucose, and triglycerides didn’t budge.)\n\nNow, here’s an important catch: The research was still pretty short-term, only looking at biomarkers in people during a few months. So it’s not clear what effects on disease risks longer-term fasting will have, even though the changes to biomarkers look promising.\n\nWhat’s more, 25 percent of people who were assigned to the fasting group in the first part of this study dropped out, compared to 10 percent of those in the regular diet group. That suggests that fasting is hard and maybe not for everyone — even when you’re part of a study. So someone like John Kane, who lost a lot of weight through fasting and loves it, may be in the minority.\n\nStill, researchers are exploring whether fasting might help fight cancer, or help cancer patients tolerate chemotherapy. And they’re putting serious thought into whether fasting has a role in treating and preventing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But while the animal literature is rich, the literature in humans is promising — though far from conclusive. As this 2017 review of the science found, the studies on fasting to control Type 2 diabetes come to contradictory results, and there’s “minimal data” comparing the effects of fasting to plain old calorie restriction in overweight or obese people with the disease. There were also no studies on fasting and human cancer rates.\n\nFasting may help you lose weight — if you can stick to it\n\nAs for weight loss, Longo said, “We see this as a bonus.” There are a couple of reasons some people seem to slim down from periodic fasts. The first one is obvious: Any type of fasting involves restricting your calorie intake for prolonged periods of time, which may lead to a lower overall energy intake and weight reduction.\n\nThe second one is more subtle: The body shifts into fat-burning mode when it doesn’t get food for an extended period of time. That’s because the body’s first source of fuel is glycogen, and it only turns to burning body fat once that quickly available energy source is depleted. So when you fast for long enough, you drive down stores of glycogen and start burning fat tissue. “In people, we see a change in fasting glucose — it’s lower — and abdominal fat is affected without much of an effect on the muscles,” Longo explained.\n\nBut people don’t always lose weight on fasting diets — and they don’t necessarily lose more than on plain, old calorie-restriction diets.\n\nSome of the best evidence on the impact of fasting on bodyweight and fat comes from a December 2018 systematic review. The researchers looked at randomized controlled trials of intermittent fasting and found that the people who fasted lost about 4 to 8 percent of their original bodyweight, on average. So fasting worked, but, interestingly, it didn’t outperform regular, continuous calorie restriction (“eat less every day” dieting), and it didn’t lead to dramatic weight loss.\n\nIntermittent fasting also improved people’s blood sugars, lipid values, and blood pressure — but again, about as much as the traditional daily (non-intermittent) energy restriction.\n\nThere are a couple of other caveats here. Fasting diets require working through hunger, saying no to the bagels and muffins put out in your morning meeting or the food at your business lunch. So it’s no surprise that many people can’t stick to fasting diets long enough to keep the weight off. In another 2018 review of the literature on fasting’s impact on weight, the researchers note, “Dropout rates have been as high as 40 percent. Thus, despite the statistical significance of weight loss results, the clinical significance and practicality of sustaining an [intermittent fasting] regimen are questionable.”\n\nThere are some people who should never fast\n\nDebra Safer, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, told me in 2016 that people with troubled relationships with food should think twice before fasting to lose weight.\n\n”The research evidence generally shows that patients with eating disorders do best when they eat regular meals and snacks,” Safer said. “Intermittent restriction of intake is often one of the behaviors that people with eating disorders engage in as part of their eating disorder — and it often sets them up to binge and/or purge.”\n\nSo in people with eating disorders, fasting is “potentially risky in that it disrupts attempts to build and maintain hard-won normalized eating patterns.”\n\nLongo warned that any fasting diet should start with a visit to the doctor. Fasting studies have not been done in children, very elderly people, or people who are underweight — so it’s possible fasting could be harmful in these cases. “If you’re a diabetic and taking insulin or any other drugs, or if you have metabolic disorders, you should not fast,” he added, noting that fasts done poorly can also increase the risk of gallstones.\n\nResearchers are still very unsure about ideal eating frequency and timing\n\nHaving talked to researchers about whether to eat breakfast and the health impact of eating late at night, one thing is clear: The scientific community is still very unsure about the best timing and frequency of eating for health.\n\nIn one study, researchers called for a clinical trial tracking people who follow multiple eating patterns — from a regular three-meal model to complete fasts — since that kind of comparative study has never been done.\n\nFor some, fasting periodically may be a helpful weight control strategy. A couple of the intermittent fasting adherents I spoke to, including John Kane, told me they find it simpler to avoid food from time to time instead of worrying about everything they put in their mouths.\n\nFasting may even help you stave off disease and live longer. Maybe. Just know that there are lots of question marks about the long-term health consequences of fasting. And, as Longo said, there’s a reason fasting has been around for so long but very few people do it regularly: “It’s too difficult.”"

    "news": "About 40% of grandparents spent more than $500 on their grandchildren in a year.\n\nNancy Schlossberg plays on the beach at Longboat Key, Fla., with her granddaughter Stevie, 2 1/2. Schlossberg is trying to figure out how to pay for her three grandchildren`s college educations. (Photo: Rod Millington for USA TODAY)\n\nNancy Schlossberg, 85, Sarasota, Fla., who has three young granddaughters, says the tradition in her family is for grandparents to pay for their grandchildren`s college education and after-school activities such as dance classes and piano lessons. Her grandparents paid for her education. Her parents paid for her two children`s college educations.\n\nSchlossberg, a widow who is retired from her job as a professor of counseling psychology, is trying to figure out how she can afford to keep up the tradition. \"I am working with my financial planner on how I can help pay for their college when they are ready. I don`t know if I can swing the whole thing. I certainly can`t afford private, elite colleges.\n\n\"But my kids are understanding, and they would never want me to spend money than I need for living expenses,\" says Schlossberg, author of Revitalizing Retirement.\n\nMany grandparents who are retired or nearing retirement find themselves in a situation where their grandchildren need their help, financial and otherwise. It`s a dilemma because grandparents have to balance their grandchildren`s needs without jeopardizing their retirement savings.\n\nGrandparents have been helping with grandchildren through the ages, often acting as \"a safety net for their families,\" says Amy Goyer, AARP`s family and caregiving expert and author of Things to Do Now That You`re ... a Grandparent.\n\nThe most recent AARP study of 1,904 grandparents found that 96% of grandparents say they spend money on their grandchildren with 40% saying they spent more than $500 on their grandchildren in a year. Grandparents say they contribute to several major expenses: 53% to education costs; 37% to everyday living expenses; 23% to medical or dental bills.\n\nAbout 11% of grandparents say they have grandchildren living with them; 16% say they provide day care services for their grandchildren while the parents are at work or school, AARP found.\n\nGoyer says there are many different situations that lead to grandparents rearing their grandchildren or contributing significantly to their upbringing: An adult child may have financial problems or have gotten divorced and need help. In some cases, both parents who are in the military may be deployed. Or an adult child with children may have lost their job, have a health problem, be dealing with substance abuse issues, be incarcerated or have passed away, and the grandparents come to the rescue, she says.\n\nGoyer has met hundreds of grandparents who are either raising their grandchildren or helping support them. \"When you talk to these grandparents, some of them are so stressed out that they immediately start talking about the challenges they face.\"\n\nThey may be struggling with all the costs of clothing, food, housing, education, child care and health care, she says. And they may have a grandchild who was born with a drug or alcohol addiction, have an attachment disorder, chronic asthma or other health or emotional issues and need expensive medical and mental health help.\n\nShe says grandparents often tend to focus more on taking care of the grandchildren than themselves. If the children need money for new shoes, tutoring, counseling or extracurricular activities, grandparents may skip having a prescription refilled or a doctor`s appointment, Goyer says.\n\nBut even grandparents who are overwhelmed by the challenges often point out that their grandchildren are the \"light of their lives,\" she says. They say things like, \"My grandchildren are the biggest blessing in my life. I don`t know what I`d do without them. They give me a reason to get out of bed every day.\"\n\nCertified financial planner Brian Power, one of the owners of Gateway Advisory in Westfield, N.J., has multiple clients with adult children who have run into financial difficulties and moved back in with their parents, bringing the grandchildren with them.\n\nIn most cases, it`s a very stressful situation, because the grandparents are withdrawing money from their retirement accounts faster than they had planned, he says. \"Sometimes it puts a complete kibosh on their overall financial plan and their retirement. It usually delays the clients` retirement, sometimes indefinitely.\"\n\nPeople either can`t retire when they want, or they actually go back to work, Power says. He has one client, a 70-year-old attorney, who is continuing to work to support his divorced daughter and her two children. All three live with him and his wife.\n\n\"The bottom line is the grandfather is doing what he has to do. He`d be retired if he could be, but he doesn`t feel like he can because of the outflow of money to his daughter and the grandkids.\"\n\nNew York-based attorney Ann-Margaret Carrozza says a trend she`s seeing is adult children are naming their parents as the guardians of their children in their wills. And when that`s the case, it may need to be factored into retirement plans because \"kids are incredibly expensive, and it will take a toll on the grandparents financially,\" she says.\n\nRetirees need to be realistic about how much they can help financially, she says. \"A big issue that I see is grandparents being asked to co-sign on student loans. This is usually a very big mistake,\" Carrozza says. \"Given that there are fewer jobs requiring college degrees than there are newly minted college graduates, chances of a debt-laden student falling behind on payments is higher than ever. If that happens, the grandparents will be on the hook for the loan.\"\n\nAnything can happen, she says. \"I have a client whose grandson died, and she is still responsible for his student loans because she co-signed the loan. My advice to clients being asked to co-sign is to say no,\" she says. \"Instead, come up with an amount that you can comfortably part with and offer to cover your grandchild`s books or other more manageable expenses.\"\n\nA recent Fidelity Investments survey found that most (72%) of grandparents think it`s important for them to help pay for their grandchildren`s college education, but only about a third (37%) say they`re currently saving for their grandkids` college expenses.\n\nFidelity`s Keith Bernhardt says, \"Helping pay for college is an amazing gift from a grandparent, but when making those plans, it`s important that they also keep their own long-term financial needs in mind, making sure to provide for their own future first.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1mSND0O"

    "news": "Joe McKendry\n\nBy the time of the American Civil War, in the 1860s, morphine was a battlefield staple, shot into soldiers to ease the pain of wounds and to treat the dysentery and malaria that raged through military camps. Home gardens in both the North and the South were ablaze with poppies as citizens patriotically grew opium for their troops; the raw drug was then processed into morphine and rushed to the front. Millions of doses were given. Thousands of veterans with lifelong wounds were taught how to use syringes to self-administer the drug long after the war ended; morphine and syringes were sold by mail order and over the counter at drugstores.\n\nAs morphine’s medical uses increased—for surgery, for accidents, for pretty much any disease or injury—so did the number of patients dependent on the drug. Scientists called this new epidemic “morphinism” and tried with increasing concern to find ways to control it. Enter the German company Bayer and its new drug, Heroin. Bayer’s tests showed that Heroin was up to five times stronger than morphine and far less habit-forming. It also seemed to have the unusual ability to open up airways in the body, so the company started selling it, at home and overseas, to treat coughs and breathing disorders as well as morphine addiction. For $1.50, Americans around the turn of the century could place an order through a Sears, Roebuck catalog and receive a syringe, two needles, and two vials of Bayer Heroin, all in a handsome carrying case.\n\n— Adapted from Ten Drugs: How Plants, Powders, and Pills Have Shaped the History of Medicine, by Thomas Hager, published by Abrams\n\nThis article appears in the March 2019 print edition with the headline “When the Sears Catalog Sold Heroin.”"

    "news": "Kishen’s university friends at Cambridge completely understood when he talked to them about the sort of novel that should be written about India—the sort of novel that he wanted to write. The thing was, he explained, to get the integers right, to be sure that these were sunk into the deepest layers of the Indian experience: caste-ridden villagers, urban slum dwellers, landless laborers, as well as the indecently rich of commerce and industry. His own integers were sunk in a prosperous gated colony in New Delhi. Here he returned from Cambridge to live with his mother and his elder brother, Shiv, in the villa that his late father had commissioned in the International Style, which was prevalent at the time. During Kishen’s absence, Shiv had got married—in a big, traditional wedding, which Kishen couldn’t attend because he was in the middle of his finals. So he didn’t meet his new sister-in-law until his return. He hadn’t meant to stay in India. He’d wanted to go back to Cambridge and maybe study for another degree until he felt himself ready to start on his life’s work. But then this happened, she happened: his sister-in-law, Naina. It hadn’t been an arranged marriage; Kishen’s mother was too modern to arrange marriages for her sons. A respected economist, she had always been at the forefront of educated Indian women. Sometimes she and her elder son even served on the same committees, for Shiv was a high-ranking bureaucrat. He had met his bride at a reception in honor of her uncle, a member of parliament, who had brought Naina from her father’s estate in their native province for her first visit to New Delhi. She was very young, shy, scarcely educated, though she had attended an élite girls’ boarding school in Jaipur. After her marriage, her mother-in-law tried to encourage her to study at some New Delhi college, but Naina claimed to be too stupid—yes, even for domestic science. Although Kishen couldn’t help agreeing that she was, to some extent, stupid, she was the only person in the house with whom he was eager to discuss his projected novel. She took no interest in it at all, yet somehow she casually disposed of one of his greatest problems: how to communicate the nuances of Indian life in English, which was the only language in which he could truly express himself. Naina simply jumbled up her languages, English and Hindi. When he tried to talk to her about his work (because he wanted to talk to her about everything), she didn’t even pretend to listen. Instead, she said, “I’m meeting the girls—coffee pina hai. Aoge? Chalo bhai we’ll have some fun—mazza ajaiga.” She had formed her own circle of girlfriends, and Kishen soon became a source of entertainment for them. Naina was proud of the way he amused them and humored all their concerns. They valued his opinion in matters of style, and also of culture, though he laughed at their taste, which hadn’t changed since they were schoolgirls. They held morning coffee parties in the smartest Connaught Place restaurants or watched pirated films together on the giant screens in their giant living rooms. When they cried at a heroine’s onscreen plight, Kishen would murmur some remark into Naina’s ear, converting her tears into giggles, which soon spread to all the weeping girls. They liked attending polo matches and pretending to be in love with the contestants, who were princelings from the President’s Bodyguard. These young women were all married, but mostly to rich, paunchy businessmen who in no way resembled the polo players. Only Shiv was tall and handsome (the opposite of Kishen), and Naina’s friends sincerely appreciated her good luck. So did she, though she was, or pretended to be, critical of Shiv: of his absorption in his work, which didn’t leave enough time for her; of his lack of interest in the romantic films and books she adored. She often laughed about him—she imitated his walk, the way his feet splayed outward, so busy, so important—and Kishen laughed with her. If his mother overheard them, she rebuked them but couldn’t help smiling with pride in her elder son, which she knew Naina, for all her mockery, shared. Only Kishen’s laughter was genuine. Mother and Shiv, both busy with their work, were glad that Kishen and Naina were such good company for each other. But sometimes Mother would ask, “And your work?” For she was waiting for Kishen to become as successful in his field as Shiv was in his. “Coming along,” Kishen answered, and he considered this to be true. He felt that, with Naina and her friends, he was immersing himself in his material. They were the integers with which he would build his world—the India that he knew, not what others thought he should know. The girls, too, were waiting for him to become published and famous. When they asked what he was writing about, he said, “You.” That made them laugh, and they clamored for a percentage of the fortune he was going to make with their lives. Meanwhile, he entertained them with stories, anecdotes from their New Delhi social world—hungry kites swooping over an open-air banquet, new, palatial apartment buildings without electricity or water, the Ayurvedic doctor poking his tented patients through their burkas, the dire results of a homeopath mixing up his aphrodisiacs with his laxatives. “You should write it down!” the girls exclaimed—and, at their urging, he began to do so. They snatched the pages from him and sent them to the editor of a leading English-language newspaper, who was a friend of all the girls and the lover of one. These writings—these tongue-in-cheek anecdotes—became the basis of his local fame. A magazine commissioned a weekly column; he was read everywhere. Mother returned from her meetings reporting the chuckles of her fellow committee members; Shiv quoted a cabinet minister who said that Kishen “had hit the nail right on the head.” Everyone was proud of him. That was during his first two years back in India. Then things began to change in the house. Actually, physically, they had begun to change soon after Naina’s arrival. Mother had originally furnished the house with the newfound enthusiasm of the intellectual classes for indigenous Indian handicrafts—vibrant textiles from Orissa, village women’s silver anklets turned into ashtrays. Now another layer was added, for whenever Naina went home to see her family—which she did often in those first years—she brought back precious objects of her own. These were not village handicrafts but something differently indigenous: the gaudy taste of the maharajas’ palaces, which had drifted down to her own family of feudal landowners. She installed multicolored chandeliers, oil paintings of hunting parties and court ceremonials. Mother’s bright hand-loomed rug was replaced by the pelt of a recently killed tiger. Naina was so proud of these acquisitions that Mother even allowed the head of a water buffalo to be nailed to the wall, though it had to be taken down when, having been improperly embalmed, it began to decay and disintegrate. Then came Naina’s first pregnancy, for which, in accordance with custom, she went home. When she reappeared, it was not only with a baby but with his nurse. This nurse, known as Bari-Mai, had been Naina’s mother’s and Naina’s and was now very old. She spoke in a dialect that only Naina could understand, and she made it clear that no one in the house was of any importance to her except Naina, whom she called Devi (goddess), and the baby, Munna. But with Kishen Bari-Mai did establish a peculiar relationship. From the first moment she saw him, she wheezed so much that she could only point at him in derision—but for what? Naina said, “It’s because she’s never seen anyone like you.” “You mean, anyone so ugly?” “Aré, gosh, darling, yeh kya baat hai? What are you saying?” She stroked his cheek, and, although he liked this affectionate gesture, it made him aware that he was short, squat, and balding: ugly, no doubt, to both her and Bari-Mai. “Dekho, Baba—Papa hai!” Naina called out when Shiv came home from the office, and she thrust the bundled baby into his arms. Shiv held him nervously. No one in the family felt comfortable holding the baby. There was something disconcerting to them in the many little amulets he wore around his neck and wrists, each guarding him against a disease or the Evil Eye. He was also greasy from the oil that Bari-Mai smeared on him for the health of his skin and hair. And he had a peculiar smell, which was not that of a baby but more—though no one said it—that of Bari-Mai. For not only did she clutch him all day but she slept with him at night, on the floor of the nursery that Mother had furnished for him with a new white cot, a playpen, and a mural of Mother Goose rhymes. After Munna’s birth, Naina abandoned the outings with her girlfriends, and Kishen stayed home with her. She was very free in his presence, suckling the baby at her great round brown nipples, while Kishen sat near her, scribbling a piece for his column. He was a chain-smoker, and sometimes she had enjoyed a cigarette with him. Now she returned to chewing betel, and one day she ordered Bari-Mai to prepare one for Kishen as well. “Open your mouth,” she told him, and he was about to obey her when he saw his mother’s cook making warning gestures at him from behind the door. “Aré—open—kholo, bhai,” Naina said impatiently. Ignoring the cook, Kishen allowed her to pop the leaf into his mouth. He disliked the taste and the feel of it. He asked, “What does she put in it?” Naina laughed. “Khas cheez hai—something very special to make you love Munna and me forever.”\n\nIt was Kishen’s birthday, and Mother had a gift for him. She watched him unwrap it: a slim volume tastefully bound in hand-loomed cloth, containing reprints of his newspaper and magazine articles. Full of her own excitement and pleasure, she said, “It’s all there. All your beautiful work.” He thanked her, kissed her, but he thought, Is this all you expect from me? They were interrupted by the cook, who burst in on them, wailing, “With my own eyes!” He had seen with his own eyes how she—the witch, Bari-Mai—had stirred a powder, a poison, into Kishen’s birthday pilao. Naina came rushing in, shouting that Bari-Mai had wanted only to add her own touch with a pinch of saffron. “Zaffran,” the cook repeated angrily. “As if I don’t know zaffran.” Naina had already turned from him to Munna, riding on her hip. “Bolo—Happy birthday, Chacha-Uncle!” She thrust him forward to greet Kishen with sticky caresses. But later, when they were alone, she said, “It’s all lies. Don’t believe them.” “No,” Kishen said. “I don’t believe Bari-Mai is trying to poison us.” “They’re all crazy. Pagal hai sab. They think she’s a terrible witch.” “It’s you,” he said. “You’re the terrible witch.” Before she could say anything, he went on, helplessly waving his arms, “I’m twenty-seven years old today and I haven’t done a thing. No! No, I have not written a beautiful book. Only Mother thinks so.” “Munna thinks so,” Naina said, nibbling Munna’s ear. “When Munna grows older, he’ll laugh at me as I’d laugh at anyone who wrote this sort of rubbish. But what’s the use of talking to you? You don’t listen to anything I try to tell you.” “Oh, yes. I’m very stupid.” “You are—no ideas, no theories—thank God! If you had them, if you drove me crazy the way I drive myself crazy, thinking and theorizing and doing nothing all day but sitting here with you and all night thinking about you—it’s you, you who’s poisoning me. No, don’t go away!” To keep her from leaving, he put his arms around her waist. At first too surprised to resist him, she then did so with ease. Not only was he shorter than she; he was overweight and breathless with lack of exercise. She gave him a push that sent him staggering backward to the floor, then stared down at him with angry, kohl-rimmed eyes. He stared back, partly in fear of her, partly in fear of himself and the sensation that had filled him when he touched her hot, soft flesh. The next moment, she put out her hand to pull him up; she was laughing, and he tried to laugh, too. It was all just a game between them.\n\nWhen a second boy was born, Bari-Mai decided that only she could provide the nourishment her Devi needed to breast-feed two babies. She pushed aside the cook’s stainless-steel vessels for her own blackened cauldron, into which she stirred spices unwrapped from little twists of newspaper. Noxious cooking smells—asafetida, like a gas—pervaded the house. Naina moved around her urine-and-milk-soaked kingdom with one child on her hip and another sucking at her breast. Shiv’s study was moved out of earshot of the rest of the house, and as far as possible from what had been his marital bedroom and was now inhabited by both children and Bari-Mai, who stretched out on the floor, bundled in the single cloth she wore day and night. Shiv began to come home later every night; Naina was always waiting for him. They spoke in low voices, but not intimately. Naina’s initial passion for her husband had changed into some other kind of passion, charged with resentment. Kishen, in his bedroom, willed himself not to hear, and he guessed that his mother was doing the same. When he went into her room after a restless night, he found her sitting up very straight, with her hands folded in her lap. Mother said, “Of course he comes home late—he’s very busy with meetings and conferences with the cabinet, with the Prime Minister. He’s important to the whole country.” Her voice rose. “She should be proud!” “She is proud.” “She doesn’t understand. She understands nothing.” A modern woman, Mother had set herself against the stereotypical role of mother-in-law. She was determined not to complain about her daughter-in-law, or about the encroachments, the ruin of her ordered household. So she said nothing, not even to Kishen. Instead, she stayed out of the house at meetings of her own. Kishen suspected that she was no longer elected to the offices for which she had once been the unquestioned candidate. But still she forced herself to be present—trimly dressed, her short, stylishly cut gray hair brushed back, even a dab of lipstick and rouge applied to simulate an energy that was no longer required of her. Meanwhile, the boys were growing up. They were no longer attached like limpets to their mother’s body. And then they grew up more and were sent off to boarding school in the hills. Kishen had expected that Bari-Mai would be sent away, too, but that didn’t happen. She still spent her nights rolled up at the foot of Naina’s marital bed while Shiv slept on the couch in his study. He was at the height of his career now, and there were photographs of him in the newspapers, hovering beside the Prime Minister at the signing of an agreement that he had helped negotiate. However late he came home, Naina waited up for him. Her voice had become more strident and desperate; Kishen listened in spite of himself, and he knew that Mother, too, was awake and listening. During the day, he could no longer sit quietly writing his column by Naina’s side. She kept interrupting him with complaints about Shiv; and when Kishen tried to defend his brother by saying that he was working late, she brought out the newspapers with photographs of Shiv and the Prime Minister and pointed to some female under-secretary in the background. It might have been a different woman in each picture, but Naina sneered in outrage—“Is this his work? Fine work!” Once, she dragged Kishen to the room where Shiv now spent his nights; she picked up his pillow and thrust it into Kishen’s face. “It’s her smell. Her dirty smell he brings home with him after he does what he does with her.” She made a sound of disgust and Bari-Mai echoed it with a splutter of saliva. More and more it seemed to Kishen that Bari-Mai was not a person at all but an emanation of something in Naina herself: something that had been bred for generations in the stifling women’s quarters of their desert home.\n\nIt was June, and the days were hot, cruelly hot. Kishen warned Mother not to go out, but one afternoon she said she had to—if she didn’t, goodness only knew what those new committee members would get up to. An hour later, the driver had to bring her back, and she was an old crushed woman. She lay on her bed and Kishen sat beside her; when he tried to get up, she clutched at his hand in a pleading gesture that she had never used with him before. She did it again, moments later, when they heard Naina’s voice outside, with Bari-Mai’s wild echo. “How do you stand it?” Mother whispered, and then he told her what he hadn’t quite told himself—that he was thinking of returning to England. At once, she rallied. She said that he should take another degree, or at least some sort of course. “What—now?” he said, for he was almost forty. “A course in writing,” she said vaguely, and he said, teasing her, “I thought you liked my writing the way it is.” But he knew that she wanted him to leave for other reasons—in fact, for the same reasons that he wanted to go. He looked into a writing school in Bristol, and Mother eagerly sent away for the application forms. She knew that it would take some time for these to arrive, but when six weeks had gone by she said that they would have to request them again. Although she and Kishen were alone in her bedroom, she lowered her voice: “I’ll write for them today, this time by express mail.” He nodded his consent, as though he, too, suspected that someone might be listening. The next day, Naina invited him to go out with her. She drove with abandon, so fast that he feared for the rickshaws and the wandering animals that she kept missing by inches. His timidity amused her, so he tried not to show it and sat there tense and silent, his hands clutched between his knees. She took him to an open-bazaar stall that was reputed to be the best for a kind of very spicy Delhi snack food. Kishen, with his delicate digestion, had never wanted to eat there, but Naina seemed perfectly at home. He watched her as she scooped up the little messes with her fingers in a trance of enjoyment; she soon sent him back for a second helping, which she finished just as quickly, and then—“I shouldn’t!”—for a third. At last she was sated, spread out on a rickety little bench as a tattered servant boy with a rag wiped the ground underneath it. She seemed oblivious of the looks of urgent desire directed at her by other customers and passersby, and by the proprietor himself, perched up on his platform stirring a vat of fly-spotted cream; or perhaps she was used to them, as she was used to the way that Kishen was looking at her across the table. She was almost middle-aged now, her body widened, fattened by pregnancy, by excessive eating, and by long hours of deep sleep in the hot afternoons. Yet he talked to her as he had done in her youthful years, though he knew she wasn’t listening—not in the way his mother listened when he spoke of his work, or of himself. And suddenly she interrupted him: “Why are you wanting to run back to England?” He tried to explain it to her. He told her that it was better sometimes not to be too close to one’s source of inspiration. And, as if he were talking about her as that source, she said, “But if I don’t want you to go? If I say mat jao? Please stay?” “Try to understand.” And he repeated it all—about being detached, about recollecting in tranquillity—everything that Mother and his friends in England understood and Naina didn’t. But as he talked he thought of a painting by an elderly English painter who was a friend of his mother’s; the painting depicted a giant hand caressing a mountain and was titled “I Have Touched the Breast of Mother India.” It had always made him laugh, and now Naina was laughing as though he had said something just as ludicrous. “When will you send off your application?” she interrupted. “As soon as it comes,” he said. “It hasn’t come yet? No? Sachmuch? Really?” She suppressed a smile as she opened her handbag and dug around in its messy contents. An envelope emerged; she held it out for him to see but not to take. He realized that not only did she listen at doors; she lay in wait for letters to purloin. Now she smiled at him openly, teasing him—and how could he help smiling back at her? “Shall I?” she said. “Tear it up?” She held it out, pulled it back, held it out again. It was a game now—one that he was determined to win. He leaned forward and snatched the envelope out of her hand, quite easily, because she let it go as if she knew what he would do with it: tear it in half, then in half again, all the time gazing at her for approval, which she gave. The next time Mother asked him about the application forms, he told her that he had filled them out and sent them off. She seemed satisfied, but a day or two later she fell ill. Instead of going to her meetings, she lay in her bedroom with the curtains shut and the air-conditioner on. Her face was drawn, and because her partial denture had been removed her mouth was sunken. The doctor came—he was a friend and contemporary who had worked with her on health-care reforms. He prescribed medicines, but when those didn’t work Kishen and Shiv called in other, younger doctors. Still the sickness failed to subside, and now Mother mostly lay on her bed with her eyes closed. Once, Bari-Mai, quick and agile as a monkey, clambered onto the bed and began to press down on Mother’s legs. Mother cried out in shock and Kishen, too, cried out, so that Naina removed Bari-Mai and both left indignantly, protesting good intentions. Alone with Kishen, Mother apologized; she said she was aware that it was unfair to see anything but a poor old woman in Bari-Mai, sunk in the rites and superstitions of a backward part of the country. But the cook saw more than that. He came into Mother’s room and, whispering just loud enough for her and Kishen to hear, told them how all day he was on duty in the kitchen, and even at night he stayed up to watch. But who knew—worn out by his vigilance, he sometimes dropped off to sleep for a few moments, during which Bari-Mai must have insinuated her powders and potions into his pots. How else was it that Mother had been laid low by a sickness that the greatest doctors in the world were unable to cure? “It’s unhygienic,” Shiv said, after discovering the cook asleep in the kitchen one night. When Kishen and Mother told him the reason, he said that it was psychologically unhygienic to allow such thoughts to enter their minds. Still, they continued to feel uneasy, though they were ashamed to admit it, even to each other.\n\nIt was the summer vacation, and the two boys, Munna, now fifteen, and Chottu, fourteen, came home from their boarding school in the foothills of the Himalayas. It was the same school, modelled on Eton and Harrow, that Shiv and Kishen had attended in their time. Shiv had been very successful there, Kishen less so. Both Munna and Chottu followed in their father’s footsteps, played all sports, were popular; Munna already had Shiv’s confident voice and his pompous walk. Naina couldn’t stop petting her two boys, stroking their downy cheeks, though they frowned and pretended not to like it. They bullied her, told her she was getting too fat, and did she have to chew that disgusting betel? They made her play cricket with them in the back garden; she flew like a young girl between the wickets, flushed, her hair coming down, but they kept getting her out before she could make a single run. Bari-Mai was appointed fielder; she squatted, motionless as a stone, only her jaws moving in their perpetual mumble. Shiv tried to come home from work earlier and, instead of shutting himself in his study, he sat with the boys to discuss their future. Munna wanted to join the Administrative Service, like his father, and Chottu was thinking of the Navy. Shiv considered their choices, the three of them serious together. Naina hovered around them with unwelcome interruptions—“Did you finish your milk, Munna?”—until he shouted at her that his name was not Munna but Raj Kumar. “Oh, big man,” she said, her angry stare directed not at her son but at his father, who tried not to meet it. That night, for the first time since the boys’ arrival, he and Naina fought again. The older boy was especially affected by what he overheard, and the next day he sought out Kishen. Trying to answer Munna’s questions about his parents, Kishen had to admit that he knew nothing about marriage—how could he? All he knew was that there were bound to be clashes of personality, especially between two people as different as Shiv and Naina. The boy nodded. “So you think they shouldn’t be married?” he said. Kishen avoided a reply—not because he didn’t have one but because he suspected that Naina or Bari-Mai might be listening behind the door. The boy repeated his question, and when Kishen was still silent, he gave his considered opinion, as judicious and balanced as his father’s would have been: “Maybe they should get a divorce.” The next moment, Naina came flying through the door. “Divorce!” she cried. “You dare say that in this house!” She abused him in her native dialect and then she raised her hand and slapped him. The sound of the slap echoed through the house, and remained there, ineradicable even after the boys returned to school.\n\nShiv invited Kishen to lunch at one of the new hotels, a grand palace with slippery marble floors and hothouse blooms in man-size vases. The prices here insured that only the richest Indians could gain admission. But the richest Indians were no longer the old style of businessmen, the ghee-fed descendants of milkmen and moneylenders: they were younger men, better travelled, almost cosmopolitan. Several of them came over to greet Shiv, with the respect that was due to him as a member of the administration that controlled permits and licenses. When they returned to their tables, Shiv informed his brother of their positions in the corporate world, the multi-crore companies over which they ruled. Kishen noticed his almost wistful glances at these men—and at the lively young women who accompanied them. He guessed that these were their secretaries, or perhaps their lovers, but Shiv said that they were their wives: yes, these slim, youthful women were wives, many of them mothers, too, and at the same time helpmeets, social assets to their important husbands. Here Shiv changed the subject. He said that he had now reached the highest rank of the bureaucracy; his next posting would be as an accredited ambassador, and his success in that role would depend to a large extent on his social skills, and those of his wife. “Naina wouldn’t be happy,” he said. “How do you know that?” Kishen said. “You don’t know. You know nothing about her.” Shiv, too, grew more heated. “And she knows nothing about me. And cares nothing, about my work, my career—what sort of marriage is that?” He changed the subject again. “What about you? And if you don’t mind my asking—you and the Great Indian Novel?” “I thought you liked my little pieces.” “Too soon?” “You shouldn’t be hanging around the house so much. You should be getting out, meeting people. The middle classes. The new generation of businessmen. The entrepreneurs.” “And their suitable wives,” Kishen said. Shiv’s voice became more intense, charged with suppressed anger. “She has this mad idea that I have some grand love affair going.” He laughed without laughing, cut up his meat, chewed violently. “And is it true, her mad idea?” “Of course not! And, if it were, who could blame me? Living in that house, in that atmosphere—no wonder Mother’s sick. We’re all sick. The stench of those beasts alone is enough to poison the lot of us.” He put down his knife and fork and stared at his brother, shocked at himself, though presumably he had been referring to the buffalo head, long since disintegrated, and the tiger pelt, which was going the same way.\n\nAlone with Kishen in her bedroom, Mother whispered, “Have you heard from Bristol about your application?” “They turned me down.” He lied without a qualm, and was amazed by her reaction. She covered her face and rocked to and fro. When he caught her in his arms, she clung to him and wouldn’t let him go. How thin she was, how worn away. When she released him, he tried to smile. “I didn’t realize you were so eager to get rid of me.” She stroked his head, regretting perhaps all the hair he had lost. Then she kissed him. “Go to England,” she said. “You’ll have peace of mind there.” “And if I’m far away and you get worse?” “When I know you’re writing your book, I’ll be well.” But the next day Naina told him, “Six months, that’s all. Three months, six, a year. At home we can always tell. My uncle had a mistress, Mrs. Lal, moti-taazi, plump and nice—oh, he liked her very much! But Bari-Mai knew, and others knew, too. In six months, it was all gone, like a balloon, psssst, no more moti-taazi. It was God punishing her.” “Mother has done nothing to be punished for.” “She wants my husband to leave me. She’s even set my sons against me! You think that such thoughts would come into my child’s head if she hadn’t put them there? I slapped him, God forgive me, but now God himself is slapping her—aré, sunno, where are you going?” He had got up to leave. She caught hold of his shirt, and it ripped in her hand. That made Naina laugh—her old playful, girlish laugh, like clear water running. Kishen began to take Mother to various specialists. She enjoyed driving with him from one clinic to another; he held her hand the way she had held his on the first day of school. Whatever the doctors said, she claimed to be perfectly well—a little pain here and there, but what was that at her age, compared with what others had to suffer? Still, she grew more and more gaunt, while Kishen looked on helplessly; and every morning Naina and Bari-Mai sat on the front veranda and watched them drive away. Finally, Shiv decided to send her to England, to consult with a Harley Street specialist. Kishen would have to take her. If at all possible, Shiv would join them, but meanwhile he made the arrangements for his mother and brother—the plane tickets, the hotel, the appointment with the doctor. Mother was glad to go and Kishen knew that it was for his sake. He wanted to leave, too, he thought, to be in a cool green place, to collect and recollect everything in its complexity, which was impossible here with it all pressing down on him. Yet, at the same time, he felt guilty—maybe he had no right to go, maybe his place was here, even if he hated it. “When are we leaving? Have our tickets come?” Mother asked Kishen so often that he began to believe there was some weakness in her mind. “Let them be sent by courier,” she said, and then, every day, “Has the courier come?” Kishen called the travel agent, who assured him that the tickets had been sent—yes, by courier. Kishen told him to cancel those and have duplicates sent to Shiv’s office. Shiv brought them home and Kishen at once hid them in the inner pocket of his waistcoat, where he could check several times a day and know they were safe. Naina had one of her great fights with Shiv. “Why are you sending them away? What use are your wonderful English doctors? It’s written! Written here!” Kishen, listening from Mother’s bedroom, imagined Naina drawing her finger across her forehead in the place where one’s fate is inscribed."

    "news": "At the beginning of 1962, a tall, thin-lipped thirty-three-year-old named James Ivory and a charming, cleft-chinned twenty-five-year-old named Ismail Merchant turned up on the doorstep of a bungalow on Delhi’s Alipur Road. Ivory was a budding film director, Merchant a budding film producer. Together, they were hoping to adapt a novel called “The Householder,” a social satire of contemporary Delhi, and had decided to approach the author to ask if she would help them turn it into a film. Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, diminutive and dark-haired, did not imagine herself to be a budding screenwriter. When they first telephoned her, she pretended to be her mother-in-law to put them off. “I told them I’ve never done anything like this before,” she later recalled. “But they said, ‘It doesn’t matter. We haven’t, either.’ ” The film made from her screenplay, which appeared the following year, was the first feature for all three, but far from the last. In a partnership spanning more than forty years, Merchant Ivory Productions made more than twenty films written by Jhabvala, who won Oscars for her adaptations of “A Room with a View” and “Howards End.” There’s some poignancy in the fact that Jhabvala, who died in 2013, is best known today as the third member of the Merchant Ivory team. She considered “writing film scripts” to be a hobby alongside the real work of prose. In her lifetime, she published twelve novels and eight short-story collections. She excelled at concealing herself, most famously behind her own name. In 1957, the Times book critic Orville Prescott wrote of her novels that readers “would naturally suppose that their author was an Indian, probably a high-caste Hindu educated at Wellesley.” But Jhabvala was her married name; Ruth was not Indian, a point she later took pains to stress. “At the End of the Century” (Counterpoint) gathers seventeen stories, dating from Jhabvala’s first collection, in 1963, to “The Judge’s Will,” published in this magazine two weeks before her death. They invite a face-to-face meeting with a literary figure who deserves to be reckoned with on her own terms.\n\nRuth Prawer was born in Cologne in 1927 into a bourgeois, assimilated Jewish family. Her maternal grandfather was a cantor at a prominent Cologne synagogue; her father, Marcus, a lawyer, had emigrated from Poland during the Great War. Ruth entered school the year Hitler came to power; she walked there to taunts of “Jew, Jew,” and had things thrown at her. In 1934, her father looked into emigrating to Palestine, but her mother resisted, certain that conditions in Germany would improve. It was only in April, 1939, that the family escaped to England. At the end of the war, they learned that more than forty relatives had been murdered in the camps. To those losses would be added one more: her father, broken by the news, killed himself in 1948. Ruth was by then a student of English literature at Queen Mary College, in London. When she was just six, she had had an epiphany after being asked to write a composition in school about a rabbit. “I wrote the title, Der Hase,” she recounted in a lecture. “At once I was flooded with my destiny; only I didn’t know that’s what it was. I only remember my entire absorption, delight, in writing about—giving my impression of—der Hase. To think that such happiness could be!” After that, she wrote ceaselessly, stuffing cupboards “full with unfinished novels, plays, stories”; from her teens, she wrote in English, which she came to consider her “first language.” While her elder brother, Siegbert, studied Modern Languages at Cambridge (he went on to become a distinguished scholar of German literature), she produced an M.A. thesis on “The Short Story in England, 1700-1750.” It’s a telling sign of affinity for a form she would come to excel at. At a party in 1949, Ruth met Cyrus Jhabvala, an Indian Parsi architect who had come to England a few years earlier to study. Jhabvala had already bought his ticket home, but by the time he set sail for India he and Ruth were engaged. Two years later, having secured a job lecturing on architecture at Delhi Polytechnic, he came back to England to marry her, and the couple settled in Delhi. From Austerity Britain, where “everything was pretty basic and grim and grey,” the new Mrs. Jhabvala found herself transported to a “grand fairy land, full of sights and sounds and colors,” as she related in a later interview. There were exotic flowers, birds, and smells; captivating music performed by female vocalists “who for me were somehow an expression of everything a woman artist does”; and sweets that she consumed by the pound, “the essence of all sweetness that there ever could be.” Jhabvala’s early fiction sauntered into middle-class Hindu households and wryly took the measure of their dramatic capacity: shy newlyweds and demanding mothers-in-law, pompous patresfamilias, feckless sons, and snooping aunties. The opening stories of “At the End of the Century” introduce Jhabvala’s remarkable economy of expression, devoid of sandalwood-scented, curry-flavored, bangle-clanging exoticism. Jhabvala sketches character, and by implication plot, in a few quick flicks, as in a tale of two rivalrous brothers, the elder “with his silk suit, his big ring, his oiled and scented hair,” and the younger “puny and insignificant,” who works as a shop attendant “with just the right mixture of dignity and obsequiousness.” If Jhabvala has an anthropologist’s curiosity about how society functions, she’s a decidedly nonparticipant observer; her narrative stance brings together candor and detachment. She’s unsparing about the constraints and the tedium of women’s lives, for instance, but also about the women who are leading them. The wife of a devoted elderly aristocrat, trapped among “provincial, dreary, unrefined people,” seeks diversion in the arms of an abusive local policeman. A young widow manages to resist the gestures of self-abnegation expected by her late husband’s family, and pursues corporeal indulgences “not for pleasure, but compulsively, sunk in sloth and greed because soft beds and foods were all that life had given to her.” In “A Course of English Studies,” Jhabvala delivers an astute portrait of an upper-class Indian woman in England whose feeling of cultural dislocation hinges as much on her own sense of entitlement as on her loneliness and unfamiliarity. Anita Desai notes in the introduction to this collection that it was Jhabvala’s “fate to be presented to Western readers as a Jane Austen.” Jhabvala’s prose does share Austen’s acerbic wit and a well-cadenced fluency, confident in the strength of syntax to sustain explication—and comedy—without flashy language. As a screenwriter, Jhabvala learned to write with still greater economy. (“One sentence in a film is like, you know, fifteen or twenty sentences in a book,” she once said.) Her best novels are short, and her short stories are often better. What the Austen analogy doesn’t capture is Jhabvala’s role as a preëminent social historian of newly independent India. Neither English nor Indian (nor even truly Anglophone before adolescence), Jhabvala came to her subjects without being trailed by the shadow of empire. Her ability to make fiction out of the bourgeois Indian everyday was revelatory to younger post-colonial writers such as Desai, for whom Jhabvala was “the first one who was writing about my world, our world.” Jhabvala also chronicled a distinctive phase in encounters between Indians and Westerners, as a last generation of imperial Britons trickled away and new customs, new tastes, and new people (increasingly American) stepped in. This is movingly captured in the 1965 Merchant Ivory film “Shakespeare Wallah,” Jhabvala’s first original screenplay. The movie follows a British family’s acting company as it tours India performing Shakespeare to dwindling audiences. Early in the film, the troupe encounters an itinerant monkey trainer who laments that people no longer care for his art. “Our story exactly,” one of the actors murmurs. Jhabvala’s script was inspired by the 1947 diaries of a real-life actor-manager, Geoffrey Kendal, but its brilliance lies in her turning what could have been a nostalgic period piece about the end of empire into a coming-of-age tale centered on the family’s teen-age daughter. (Kendal’s younger daughter, Felicity, made her screen début in the film, starring opposite her brother-in-law, Shashi Kapoor.) The Raj, for Jhabvala, was a closed chapter. She preferred to turn the page.\n\nThe nineteen-sixties brought a new wave of ebullient Westerners to India to “find themselves,” and Jhabvala was waiting with a skewer. “Which Yoga do you do? Hatha Yoga or Bhakti Yoga or what?” a European seeker asks the Indian hero of “The Householder.” None, he confesses. “Well you should,” she chides. “How do you think you’ll meet the Eternal and the Infinite if you don’t?” Many of Jhabvala’s novels and stories feature credulous Westerners (usually female) in thrall to charismatic Indian gurus (invariably male). Jhabvala generally musters a flicker of sympathy for those who know not what they do. In the story “A Spiritual Call,” we learn that Daphne “had always been known as straightforward and sensible, good at sickbeds, had done history at Oxford, wore tasteful, unobtrusive, English clothes. Yet when she met Swamiji she knew without a word being spoken that he meant her to follow him back to India.” This will not end well for her. In Jhabvala’s fiction, gurus are, to a man, grifting, lecherous, manipulative—and successful. “ ‘I have many warm invitations from America,’ Swamiji said. ‘From California especially.’ ” Jhabvala made a comedy out of these encounters in her 1969 screenplay for “The Guru,” about an English rock star who, like George Harrison, comes to India to study sitar. But in her prose the figure of the dangerous seducer sometimes swells to take on the dimensions of India itself. “I had come to India to be in India,” the narrator of “An Experience of India” says. “I wanted to be changed.” Leaving her journalist husband in Delhi, the woman sets off on a series of sexual and spiritual adventures, exulting in the sense of freedom and discovery. Eventually, she becomes jaundiced, literally and figuratively: “Everything I had once liked so much—people, places, crowds, smells—I now feared and hated.” Like many Jhabvala heroines, she ends up longing to escape from India but finds herself incapable of doing so, an addict drugged by experience. “He suffers from post-holiday elation.” “An Experience of India” was the title story of a 1971 collection, which Jhabvala prefaced with an autobiographical essay, “Myself in India.” In it, Jhabvala describes being spun around a wheel of Western reactions to India, writing, “First stage: tremendous enthusiasm—everything Indian is marvelous; second stage, everything Indian not so marvelous; third stage, everything Indian abominable.” She can no longer shake an awareness that “the most salient fact about India is that it is very poor and very backward.” She shuts the blinds, cranks up the air-conditioning, and buries herself in literature in an effort to avoid the deprivation around her, but “all the time I know myself to be on the back of this great animal of poverty and backwardness.” The piece presents Jhabvala at her acid best, in a viciously observed sketch of Delhi high society: the Oxbridge-educated hostess is attired in “handloom saris and traditional jewelry,” “trays of iced drinks are carried around by servants in uniform, and there is intelligent conversation, and then there is a superbly arranged buffet supper and more intelligent conversation.” The hostess and her guests “know modern India to be an important subject,” Jhabvala goes on, “but though they themselves are modern India, they don’t look at themselves . . . except with the eyes of foreign experts whom they have been taught to respect.” Candid to a fault, “Myself in India” loses its pungency when Jhabvala posits that “most Indians” ignore poverty because of “their belief in reincarnation,” and lapses into tired, if deliberately hyperbolic, characterizations of India as a “bog of passive, intuitive being,” oppressive heat, and fervent paganism. In a later interview, she likened living in India to being in Biblical times, “when there were beggars and lepers.” “Well,” she tutted, “you don’t want to be in Biblical times.” Jane Austen, meet V. S. Naipaul. Indian critics turned on her. It’s one thing to criticize a society from within; it’s another to do so as a foreigner—and a woman. “If you don’t say that India is simply paradise on earth, and the extended Hindu family the most perfect way of organizing society, you’re anti-Indian,” she told a Times interviewer in 1983. “I don’t have many readers there.” Pankaj Mishra has suggested that Jhabvala may have grown so bitter because she lacked “the wide range of experience that V. S. Naipaul and E. M. Forster attested to.” Never mind that she lived in India for decades, unlike either man, and raised three daughters there, and learned to write Hindi. These are essentially the terms Naipaul himself applied to, yes, Jane Austen, whom he disdained as a writer of “sentimental ambitions” with a “narrow view of the world.” Aspects of “An Experience of India” recur in Jhabvala’s 1975 novel, “Heat and Dust,” which tells the parallel stories of a British woman in India in 1923 and her husband’s granddaughter, who travels to the same town fifty years later. A mashup of Jhabvala’s earlier fiction and Forster’s “The Hill of Devi,” about his visits to a small princely state, the book feels both warmed over and overwrought. But “Heat and Dust,” the only one of Jhabvala’s novels to portray India under the Raj, also became her most successful when it won the Booker Prize—which two years earlier had been awarded to J. G. Farrell’s “The Siege of Krishnapur,” set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, and two years later went to Paul Scott’s “Staying On,” about a retired British couple who continue living in India after independence. The Merchant Ivory adaptation of “Heat and Dust” came out in 1983 amid a flurry of Raj nostalgia, flanked on the big screen by “Gandhi” and “A Passage to India,” and joined by the TV miniseries “The Jewel in the Crown” and “The Far Pavilions.” But by then the Booker Prize had been awarded to Salman Rushdie’s “Midnight’s Children” (1981), marking a new era in literary portrayals of the subcontinent. And Jhabvala had quit India. She used the Booker Prize money to move to New York, buying an apartment in the Upper East Side building where Ivory and Merchant resided.\n\nJhabvala felt instantly at home in the city. While Europe would forever “smell of blood”—she never returned to Germany—New York was, she said, “the most European place on earth I know.” She rediscovered the Old World of her youth in jars of pickled cucumbers and herring on deli counters; at ballets and concerts; among the furnishings and the accents of her past. She spent the rest of her life based in New York, albeit with a strong tie to India through her beloved husband, whom she called Jhab. Cyrus Jhabvala maintained his architecture practice in Delhi and Ruth spent winters with him there; Cyrus visited New York regularly until he retired and joined her in the United States full time. Jhabvala spoke little about her particular writing choices, but she often described herself as a chameleon, writing about whatever milieu she inhabited. Henceforth she set her fiction largely in America, often among European migrants. The later stories in “At the End of the Century” introduce readers to “prosperous émigrés from various Central European countries,” who “spoke only in English, though their heavy accents made it sound not unlike their native German”; and wan, wealthy women equally at home in New York, London, or Los Angeles. In some ways, it must have helped Jhabvala’s literary reputation to move to New York at this transitional moment for Indians writing in English. Quite aside from the politics of nationality (when Arundhati Roy won the Booker, in 1997, she was celebrated as the first “true Indian” to do so), Jhabvala’s clipped social satire belongs to a world entirely different from the sprawling canvases and the linguistic innovation of Roy, Rushdie, Amitav Ghosh, and Vikram Seth. Then, too, India had little traction among American readers; even James Ivory confessed that he didn’t read her early New Yorker stories, “because at that point I didn’t have much interest in India, and they were Indian stories.” So a shift in setting anchored her in an American literary marketplace. The focus of her screenwriting changed, too. In the late seventies, Jhabvala proposed an adaptation of Henry James’s “The Europeans” to Merchant and Ivory, anticipating that the book would be a good match for Ivory’s sensibility. The ensuing series of classic adaptations and historical dramas completed the team’s transformation from makers of lighthearted India-themed films into an Oscar-winning Hollywood brand. Jhabvala’s fiction does not seem to have benefitted similarly. She published less during her decades in the United States than she had in India, and fewer novels in particular. Judging from their quality, that was perhaps no bad thing. In “Three Continents” (1987), a novel about American naïfs caught up in a Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh-style cult, the characters get crushed under a tediously overextended plot. The book seems to have originated in an idea for a screenplay, and its failure as a novel underscores the sense that Jhabvala’s irony and restraint flourished better in compact frames. Though some of the American stories deliver flashes of the Jhabvala economy—New York captured in snatches of “street smells, petrol fumes, leaking gas pipes, newly poured tar, pretzels, mangoes from Mexico, Chinese noodles, overblown flowers”—her satirical edge, so keen in the Indian fiction, is dulled. Maybe it’s harder to convey ironic detachment when you feel more at home. There’s an evanescence to many of these Western tales, as if Jhabvala’s writing turned its face away from the sun and grew obscure. Two of the central characters in the collection’s title story fade entirely by the time it ends; in the parting scene, they appear only in a photograph, “a shimmer of two figures in light-coloured clothes on the verge of disappearing from sight.” It’s in the later stories in this volume that one becomes aware of how much triangulation pervades Jhabvala’s work. It’s not just classic love triangles, though there are many of those—best portrayed in the collection’s final story, “The Judge’s Will,” in which a widow discovers the existence of her husband’s longtime mistress. Jhabvala is an artful geometer, and she skews her angles boldly. Consider “Ménage,” in which a daughter finds out that her mother and aunt share a lover, before sleeping with him herself. Or “Pagans,” in which two sisters sleep with the husband of one, and take up the same young Indian protégé. Or “Great Expectations,” the puzzling account of an American woman who becomes a surrogate mother qua partner to a self-involved divorcée and her adolescent daughter. These stories, set primarily in New York, are among the weakest in the collection—or maybe it’s that by the time one gets to them the pattern appears formulaic."

    "news": "WRAP UP,” the big, blinking sign kept telling her last night. But after teetering all the way to that stage in the kind of five-inch heels she’d always assumed were reserved for prostitutes, she couldn’t pay it any mind. Her hands were shaking, but she rambled on, cradling her Golden Globe like a puppy. For once, Lena Dunham was acting like she had plenty of time.\n\nIt was fun, though, winning a couple of awards – except the part where she ran into the ladies’ room so a friend could yank off the corset that was squeezing her into a “full-blown panic attack.” She stole everyone’s ravioli from communal plates, freaked out at seeing Adele and Bill Clinton, was transfixed by the sight of Jennifer Lawrence eating a bag of potato chips backstage. (“I was like, ‘You are a bad bitch’ – I almost tackled her and French-kissed her.”) After the ceremony, Dunham stopped by HBO’s party, but didn’t drink, as usual (“It makes me feel fuzzy and out of control in a way I don’t like”). She and her boyfriend of 10 months, fun. guitarist Jack Antonoff, made it back to their Sunset Strip hotel by 11:15 p.m. She ate a celebratory turn-down-service cookie, though Antonoff snagged the prized oatmeal one while she was in the bathroom, leaving her with “stupid chocolate chip.” Then she went to bed.\n\nWith two awards on the dresser and Antonoff beside her (until he had to leave in the early morning), Dunham slept well, free from her usual “embarrassingly classic anxiety dreams,” like the improbable one where she gets fired from Girls – the HBO show she created, stars in, writes, produces and often directs. Or the one where she wakes up and “my boyfriend doesn’t remember who I am, and he’s also dating Lana Del Rey.”\n\nDunham emerges from the elevator bank of the Sunset Tower Hotel late the next afternoon, walking with normal-human steadiness in her Zara flats (purchased for a mere $18, she mentions at least twice), greeting hotel employees by name. Her potentially intimidating confidence – part private-school poise, part Zen stillness – is undercut by the warmth of her huge Hershey-Kiss-colored eyes and the endearing, not-quite-Bugs-Bunny-ish prominence of her upper front teeth.\n\nShe looks super-put-together today, albeit in an almost middle-aged way: shiny blue blazer, white blouse with Peter Pan collar, stretchy dark slacks. Especially with her cute new short haircut, she barely resembles Hannah, her somewhat slovenly Girls character – a discrepancy that can be disconcerting. A maitre d’ at the New York restaurant Babbo, for instance, wouldn’t let the subject go. “He was like, ‘You look so much fatter on camera.’ Like, ‘Why? Why? Why?’ He was obsessing over it. I was like, ‘I don’t know what to tell you. I just don’t know what to say.`” (Some of the answer might be “acting”: “I’ve watched her transform her body to make it look weirder on camera,” says her co-star Allison Williams. “Just even by moving a shoulder to make it look more bizarre. I’m mesmerized by the heavy extent to which she’s drawn to the weirder choice.”)\n\nDunham may be the 26-year-old creative force behind the most zeitgeisty show about young people since, like, ever, but she’s also “the oldest lady trapped in that body,” says her co-showrunner and executive producer, Jenni Konner. Dunham is obsessed with and driven by a fear of death, that cosmic WRAP UP sign. She has a long list of health issues, starting with a throat that constantly gives out (“I have a bad voice the way people have a bad back”), ultrasensitive skin (“I can will myself into getting a rash”) and the fact that she’s been “vaguely nauseous” for six months (but that, she admits, may be just from reading her iPhone in the car).\n\nShe’s been known to undergo intravenous vitamin drips. She doesn’t like getting high (her last attempt involved a THC-infused Jolly Rancher during a 2011 trip to Joshua Tree, and she couldn’t stay awake – “Other than sugar, I’ve never had an intense relationship with any substance,” she says). She breaks her time down into multiple detailed to-do lists: life goals (have a kid), seasonal goals (she really wants to organize her bookshelves into already-read and to-read categories this winter), Girls goals.\n\n“It’s funny to me that I’m writing a show that people consider to be the voice of twentysomething people,” she says. “Because I don’t feel that connected to it all the time.” She sometimes has to remind herself that she’s still young, only a couple of years older than the feckless characters on her show. “I’ll sleep late, and say, ‘This is disgusting, I’m an adult woman.’ Then I realize a lot of 26-year-olds go out and get hung over.”\n\nDunham has a tellingly autobiographical idea for a movie: A stressed-out, hypochondriacal, mortality-haunted 25-year-old wakes up one morning and finds that she’s grown old overnight. “The rest of the movie is her as an 85-year-old, finally living her 25-year-old life,” she says. “Then it ends with her dying.”\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that particular project coming to fruition, but the items on her to-do lists have an alarming habit of getting checked off. She has two feature films behind her, that award-winning HBO show (plus a just-announced pilot deal for another one), a couple of funny New Yorker pieces, and a reported $3.7 million book deal. Not to mention the collective envy of the nation’s bitterest quadrant of artsy twentysomethings (the ones who send out sad tweets like, “Lena Dunham is everything I could’ve been if I hadn’t gone to public school in Nebraska”). Though Girls gets roughly half the ratings of Game of Thrones, there are days when it seems like its star is the most discussed human being on the Internet, that the show itself is the linchpin of the online-recap industrial complex, and that, pretty soon, Girls‘ Studies will replace Women’s Studies at liberal-arts colleges.\n\nLena Dunham Writing New Comedy Pilot for HBO\n\nEven Dunham’s colleagues admit that her success and work ethic can make them feel kind of bad about themselves: “It’s both depressing and motivating,” says Andrew Rannells, who played her gay ex-boyfriend. Adds Konner, “When I find a blackout in her knowledge – if she’s like, ‘Oh, I’ve never heard of that show’ – I’m always thrilled.”\n\nDunham climbs into the back seat of a chauffeured black SUV, followed by a mini-entourage of sorts: her assistant, plus one of Girls‘ producers, Ilene Landress, a sardonic New Yorker who previously worked with David Chase on The Sopranos. We’re on our way to a Santa Monica studio to approve final sound mixes for the last two episodes of Girls‘ second season, even as Dunham and her collaborators are already writing Season Three.\n\nDespite her early bedtime, Dunham is tired and hoarse, still recovering from a bout of bronchitis. “I have a little bit of, like, a delicate-flower body,” she says, as we stop at a Starbucks, where Dunham gets two teas – one hot, one cold. “Between trying to write the new season and doing press stuff and flying a lot, my body was like, ‘Nope. No more. We quit.`”\n\nThis morning, Dunham had a pre-interview with a producer for Craig Ferguson’s show, which she’ll tape tomorrow. It didn’t go well. “I was such a fail,” Dunham says. “I had nothing interesting to say.” The producer was horrified when Dunham explained why she doesn’t drive: “I’m afraid of Rebecca Gayhearting a child.”\n\n“The producer was like, ‘Do not say that!`” Dunham recalls. “And I had this part of me that was so tired that I was like, ‘I’m a punk! I’m gonna say it!’ Which is crazy and a very bad idea. So I’m just gonna say it to you.” She doesn’t want to hurt Gayheart’s feelings, she explains – “It’s just a useful reference.” The producer then tried to draw out anecdotes about Dunham’s recently adopted dog, Lamby, and she drew a blank: “He walks. He barks. I just couldn’t think of anything.”\n\nAs we drive west on Sunset through Beverly Hills, the streets turning lovelier and more tree-lined by the block, Dunham somehow manages to extract most of my résumé. Learning that I covered the long-ago criminal trial of Sean Combs and his then-protégé Shyne, she ponders Shyne’s jailhouse conversion to Judaism. “I know this is not something that I’m supposed to say,” she says, “given the criticisms I’ve received, but when, like, black people convert to Judaism, it slays me. ‘Cause why would you ever choose to be Jewish? I would not be Jewish if I had not been born Jewish. I can’t get away from it now!”\n\nDunham does have enough tribal solidarity to feel total contempt for Mel Gibson, who was a conspicuous presence at Jodie Foster’s Golden Globes table. “A weird anti-Semitic, anti-gay lunatic being her best friend?” she says. “It would be really funny if last night he was like, ‘You’re gay? Oh, my God, I had no idea.`”\n\nShe’s thinking out loud now. “At these awards shows, I used to always be looking for examples of perfectly well-adjusted people,” she says. “Now I’m like, ‘Half these people are lunatics!’ And I might be a lunatic. But I just want to see that lunacy expressed in a way that feels genuine and interesting.”\n\nInside the mixing stage, huge, sometimes-unflattering HD images of Hannah project on a screen on the far wall, while Dunham sits in back, quietly in charge. She’s the youngest person in the room. The biggest discussions revolve around representing the sound of an iPhone smashing on a floor, finding the precise dramatic moment to begin a Fiona Apple song, and reproducing the experience of tinnitus. When the time comes to pick a new music cue, Dunham seizes the first option presented by her music supervisor, an upbeat tune by breaking singer-songwriter Jake Bugg. “I liked the first one,” she says, firmly, as they keep trying other songs.\n\nAs the episodes play, Dunham is tapping steadily on her own iPhone with manicured fingers (it’s a purple-y polish called Love and Acceptance) – she’s trying to send an individualized response today to every congratulatory text and e-mail she’s received for the Globes wins. There are 138 texts in all, she says – and a middle-aged sound engineer sitting to her right shakes his head. “I don’t think I’ve gotten 138 texts, total, in my entire life,” he says. Dunham laughs, and goes back to texting.\n\nSoon enough, the mix is finished, and Dunham has some advice for the crew. “Everyone needs to go home,” she says, putting down her phone, “and fuck their wives.” Her own plans for the evening involve sitting alone in her hotel room, revising two episodes of Girls, and maybe working on an overdue essay on the 50th anniversary of The Bell Jar for a British newspaper.\n\nDunham’s parents first took her to a therapist when she was seven years old, and she’s pretty much been seeing one ever since. At that point, she was terrified of going to sleep, which she associated with the void of death. “The whole house was taken hostage by my nightmare sleep rituals,” Dunham recalls. “I remember one night my dad was so mad, he just had to take a walk around the block, and I was like, ‘Daddy’s never coming back!’ and my mom was like, ‘No, Daddy’s annoyed because you’re being a shitty asshole.`”\n\nHer parents (both successful artists – her mother, Laurie Simmons, is a photographer best known for evocative pictures of dolls and dollhouses; her father, Carroll Dunham, is an oft-phallic pop-art painter) had to tell her three fun things they were going to do the next day. Her mother would have to kiss her eyes; her dad would have to adjust the door precisely. They’d have to promise her that they’d come get her at 3 a.m. and move her to their bed. “Then I’d get up to pee, like, three times,” she says, “and they’d have to do it again each time I got back into bed. Then they’d come get me at 3 a.m., and I’d sleep at the foot of my parents’ bed like a dog. So it was, like, get this kid into therapy.”\n\nDunham was soon diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, which revved up around the age of nine. She went through a hypochondriacal phase: “AIDS, jaundice, you name it, I had it.” Then she started counting. “I was obsessed with the number eight,” she says. “I’d count eight times…. . . . I’d look on both sides of me eight times, I’d make sure nobody was following me down the street, I touched different parts of my bed before I went to sleep, I’d imagine a murder, and I’d imagine that same murder eight times.”\n\nDunham developed an intense dread of sex as soon as she learned what it was. From the evidence presented on Girls, it’s unclear whether she’s ever fully gotten over it. “I’d come up with a theory that I thought made a tremendous amount of sense,” she says, “which was that you’d lay next to someone you loved, you wished for a baby, and then the sperm and the egg met through the pores of your skin. My friend Amanda was like, ‘No, a man puts his penis in your vagina,’ and I was like, ‘This is the worst thing I’ve ever heard; this is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.’ I told my little sister when she was five, so I wouldn’t have to be alone with it. And now she’s a lesbian. So there, we’ve nailed it! That and the fact that I used to make her make out with me through my grandmother’s dialysis mask. No, that’s not why someone’s gay, but it’s a funny theory.”\n\nHer parents were not entirely surprised by any of this. “Lena was kind of a weirdo,” says Simmons. “But I was used to weirdos. I was one, and all the artists I know were probably weirdos when they were kids too. The funny thing is when two artists expect to have a superconventional child.”\n\nSimmons had grown up in suburban Long Island, where her own parents found her baffling. “That’s a really awful feeling for a kid to think, that everything they dream up, their parents find peculiar,” Simmons says. “So I just decided nothing was going to shake me up.”\n\nIn the throes of her number-eight obsession, Dunham put that ethos to the test. “I remember saying to my mom when I was little, ‘I just had to imagine having sex with you eight times,`” she says, “and she really took it in stride! She was like, ‘Well, it’s your imagination; it didn’t really happen.`”\n\nDunham didn’t have sex until college, though she did kiss a grand total of four guys in high school – two of them during a very eventful “humanitarian” trip to Cuba. “Cuban guys were really aggressive,” she says. “One put his tongue in my ear and it was exciting and traumatizing, and then as I was leaving, I was like, ‘What if he was the love of my life and I left him in Cuba?’ and my friends were like, ‘He didn’t speak English, he was maybe a street person…. . . . ‘”\n\nBy high school, Dunham had gotten control of her OCD symptoms, but she was “drugged like a big horse” on massive doses of antidepressants. “I was so exhausted all the time, night sweats,” she recalls. “I was pretty fat in high school if I look at it, because it just slows down your metabolism. My mom would always be like, ‘I think you’re having a lot of side effects,’ and I’d be like, ‘You’re such a bitch; you just want me to be skinny!’ and my mom was like, ‘No, you’re just sleeping all the time and sweaty.`” (There were some food issues, too – until recently, Dunham would ask for hotels to remove the mini-bar so she wouldn’t eat everything in it.)\n\nShe weaned of meds toward the end of college, and has been frantically productive ever since. As of last March, though, she started taking a small dose of the anti-depressant Lexapro, just enough to dampen her anxiety. She keeps Klonopin in her bag, but she’s afraid of it. “Don’t ever Google a drug,” she says, “because it’s all psychos being like, ‘This blinded me, it killed my husband.’ I once flushed all my Klonopin down the toilet, because I was so scared by what I read. But if I feel I’m in the Tower of Terror, a little piece will just let me breathe.”\n\nDunham started writing poems, short stories and what she thought were novels around third and fourth grade. She also developed a precocious penchant for self-dramatizing. At the first of the two upscale private schools she attended, Friends Seminary, she was both genuinely socially isolated and really into the role of being socially isolated. “I really liked the idea of ‘Kids don’t get me,’ ” she says. “I used to call my parents collect every single day from the pay phone in the cafeteria, in third grade, crying, ‘I want to come home,’ but I looked forward to the time of day when I could call my parents on the pay phone.” (On Girls, Zosia Mamet’s dorky, long-virginal Shoshanna represents Dunham as a child: “Shoshanna is the part of me that was terrified of sex and felt a little bit left out of the group.”)\n\nDunham fit in somewhat better at her ultra-artsy high school, St. Ann’s, where she studied playwriting, and met future Girls co-star Jemima Kirke, who would sometimes take a break from being popular to hang out. But Dunham was still oddly invested in the idea of not belonging. When her parents talked about moving to their Connecticut country house full-time after 9/11, she was excited. “I was like, ‘If I was at a public school in Connecticut, I’d be the weirdo that I always felt like I was, at this school where it was all 4-H kids.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, and I’ll have a goat!`”\n\nShe’s willing to admit to similar role-playing now, like letting stylists put her into awkwardly high heels – which fits a little too well with her anti-glam image. “I feel like I do push that angle,” she says, shrugging. “It’s like, if you have to take all of these things of, just don’t wear them!”\n\nUntil she was 13, Dunham wasn’t particularly driven. “I was really into watching Singled Out for hours,” she says. But then she faced the death of one of her best friends, who happened to be her father’s mother. “When Lena didn’t have any friends,” says Simmons, “she formed this beautiful and amazing friendship with her grandmother.”\n\nHer grandmother had been a nurse, and then a real estate agent, but “she had more capabilities than she used, because of the time in history,” says Dunham. “She could have been a doctor. She could have had a bigger, more expansive, more comfortable life. I looked at my great-aunts, or whatever, who were just sitting watching TV, and was like, ‘How do we ever just sit around loafing, if we’re just gonna die? How can people take a life and just waste it?’\n\n“And it just made me feel like, ‘No. Can’t stop. Won’t stop. I’ll sleep when I’m dead.’ I have all of her letters and photos and have really tried to keep her life preserved and am hoping to do something with them someday. So I guess it made me wish for a big, productive, preserved life.”\n\nA few days after the Globes, Dunham shows up at least a half-hour late for lunch at a Brooklyn Heights coffeehouse, proffering a sort of meta-apology: “I kept practicing this line I was going to say to you,” she says, “but I was too embarrassed to say it: ‘My lateness has been my forever life thing, it’s not a new thing.’ I just have a lateness problem that has existed since childhood.” It’s frigid outside, and she’s wearing a scarf lent to her by the lady who runs the doggy day care where she just dropped of Lamby so she could “have a productive day,” which has already included a 40-minute story conference with Girls executive producer Judd Apatow.\n\nHer eyes are still lined with now-smudged makeup from a Daily Show appearance the previous day. (“I love what it looks like when it gets crumbly and shitty.”) She orders salmon over greens; her father’s nutritionist has been urging her to eat more fish. Through the window behind her, an irregular parade of moms or nannies with strollers streams by – this is what Hannah would call grown-up Brooklyn. Dunham lives in a nearby one-bedroom – the New York Post printed the building’s location, and a stalker-y dude promptly showed up. She only recently left her parents’ Tribeca loft, the one that served as the setting for Tiny Furniture, her bleakly hilarious 2010 movie about an aimless college graduate, which led directly to Girls.\n\nLike Girls, the film drew heavily from her own post-Oberlin aimlessness, which lasted all of 18 months. She was a daytime hostess at a restaurant, worked in a toy store, baby-sat and had a law-firm job. “I remember being really depressed during all that,” she says. “I hated it. I felt my jobs were crazy and I was like, ‘How am I gonna do this? I’m gonna have to figure out a way to do this for my whole life.’ I quit the restaurant job abruptly, and my dad was like, ‘You have to think about the implications. What if you had a baby?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t have a baby!’ His point was that it’s not good practice for life to just quit things without considering where you’re headed next. And I was like, ‘We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, motherfucker!`”\n\nDunham got most of the $50,000 or so budget for Tiny Furniture from her parents (the mother of one of her friends also pitched in). This was a fact that she initially attempted to conceal, even once getting an artful evasion past The New Yorker‘s fact-checkers: She told them that Tiny Furniture was funded by three New York art-world investors, which was not technically false. (She’s since paid them all back.)\n\nOne critic called Tiny Furniture “the cinema of unexamined privilege,” which anticipated later critiques of Girls. “A lot of people think depicting some version of privilege is, in and of itself, unexamined,” says Dunham. “The movie’s not a vehicle for letting the world know that JAPs shouldn’t have to have jobs, it’s not me being like, ‘Leave these poor girls alone!`”\n\nApatow has a similar response to the show’s critics. “People talk about the show as if we’re not aware of all the awful mistakes they’re making,” he says. “People say, ‘Oh, they’re self-entitled or self-involved,’ and I always think, ‘Yeah! That’s why we have her steal the tip from the maid in the first episode!’ You can say, ‘Where are all of the ethnic people?’ and I might say back to you, ‘Yeah, where are all the ethnic people?`”\n\nArguably, Dunham’s most consequential privilege wasn’t economic: It was growing up in an environment that taught her that being creative, making things, was part of daily life. Freakishly, Dunham actually enjoys the process of writing; she’ll unwind from writing one project by working on another. While her dad is more typically tortured in his approach to painting, her mom says she has more of a “whistle-while-you-work attitude” – and Dunham spent hours watching her mom in her studio.\n\n“For me, every time I write something down,” says Apatow, “I might confirm the fact that I’m not any good. And if I’m not good, who am I as a person? Almost everyone that I work with has moments where they make jokes about how awful they are. That’s not her issue – she has an enormous amount of issues, and most of them are in the show – but luckily, that’s not one of them.”\n\nThe fact that the other female cast members of Girls are all daughters of prominent people (Mamet’s father is playwright David Mamet; Kirke’s dad is Bad Company‘s drummer; Williams’ dad is NBC’s Brian Williams) led to endless nepotism debates. “You should see how many famous people’s kids we turned down,” says executive producer Konner. The criticism even spread to Dunham herself, which seemed like a stretch. “I can’t get anyone a show on HBO,” says Simmons. “I can barely get anyone a show in a gallery!”\n\n“First of all, Jemima and I just happened to go to school together, so I don’t think that counts,” says Dunham. “But my truest answer is that Allison and Zosia, if anything, they might have come into their auditions, and this is a privileged thing, with a little less of that panting, puppy-dog, ‘I need this job’ thing, and more of a willingness to be themselves and play.”\n\nDunham saw that line of criticism coming, and she also expected discussion of the show’s frequent depiction of sex as awkward and demeaning. A closer look suggests, however, that Hannah clearly gets off on being degraded (though not to the point of being peed on) – and that her relationship with her now-ex-boyfriend, Adam, worked because he’s into doing the degrading. Says Adam Driver, the actor who plays him, “There’s something carnal and unspoken going on in those scenes.”\n\n“She can let Adam do that without thinking that he’s twisted on every single level,” adds Dunham, nodding. “I also think I always have had an attraction to depicting some degradation that I still haven’t worked out.”\n\nAnd in real life?\n\n“I had to watch out for it more in my younger days,” she says. “I’m so much less turned on by bad behavior now.”\n\nShe somehow didn’t anticipate outrage over the show’s uniform whiteness – and sees the fact that it surprised her as a problem in itself. “I didn’t really see the big hole in the show. I have to be honest and say it made me examine how I see that stuff.” The broadness of the show’s title, everyone agrees, left them particularly open to all manner of critiques. “The title White Chicks was already taken,” Dunham says. “So we couldn’t use that.”\n\nTwo excited young female fans – one of them a blonde so Scandinavian as to verge on albinism – stop by the table, asking for a picture. “They were really white,” Dunham says, laughing, as they walk away. “That’s a good point: ‘Her comment about race was interrupted so she could talk to the two whitest people I’ve ever seen.`”\n\nLast year, after wrapping the first season of a show that focuses on what Internet people like to call “First World problems,” Dunham got a taste of the Third World, heading to India with her mom. They went to Delhi and Mumbai, Jaipur and Narlai. “I had this dumb, Western idea,” says Dunham. “Like, I’m gonna go to India and it’s gonna be so transcendent that I’m not gonna be afraid of death anymore, and I’m going to lay down so many of my Western anxieties and embrace a new kind of knowingness and bring it back to the U.S.”\n\nAt age nine, Dunham had started following her mother’s practice of Transcendental Meditation – she stopped for many years, until she picked it up again with the help of a teacher Apatow had met. It helps her with her fear of death, which she describes as “a very primal, ‘I will be alone and unheard and everyone will be together somewhere else’ kind of feeling.” Somehow, she thought that a trip to the birthplace of Buddhism would complete her journey.\n\nInstead, it was overwhelming on every level, an “onslaught of pure humanity” that was a big challenge to her OCD-driven germ phobia. She ended up leaving early. “We do a really good job in this country of basically sealing off sick people and sealing of toilets and sealing of everything that lets us know we’re animals. And in India not only do they not do that, there’s no interest in doing that.”\n\nShe’s sitting in a favorite Soho macrobiotic restaurant, early on a Saturday evening. It’s been a workday for her, pushing forward on Season Three. She’ll go back and write some more when we’re done.\n\n“It’s the most beautiful culture,” she says. “I went there and my first reaction was like, ‘There is so much I don’t know.`” She had just put out her pro-Obama video – in which she freaked out conservatives by comparing first-time voting to first-time sex – but suddenly felt “unqualifed to talk about anything. It just completely cracked my brain open. I can only compare it to when I give someone else my script to make notes on and they start questioning things I didn’t even think were questionable, and it’s the worst feeling in the world. So this was too much of a note from the universe.”\n\nShe found herself sympathizing more with the stray dogs she saw than the poverty-stricken people – maybe because the human suffering was too overwhelming. “Sometimes I think that if we were, at any one instant, to truly comprehend the amount of human suffering happening in the world, we would just die,” she says, brown eyes bright. She sounds more than ever like a J.D. Salinger character, perhaps a lost Glass sibling.\n\nShe’s still processing India; she’s still processing everything. There’s so much left to write, so much to learn, and the clock’s ticking. “Some of my anxieties might be solved by a better awareness of what’s actually befalling this planet and what makes everything run and what’s come before us,” she says. “But it overwhelms me too much. It makes me want to take a nap.” She takes a breath. “And in that respect, I really relate to people in my generation.”\n\nThis story is from the February 28th, 2013 issue of Rolling Stone."

    "news": "Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists | Monday, 8 p.m., HBO\n\nThe boozy, brawling days of New York tabloids are vividly evoked in the documentary “Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists,” a portrait of columnists Jimmy Breslin, who died in 2017 at age 88, and Pete Hamill, 83. They wrote for the New York Daily News and the New York Post. They were both Irish kids, one from Queens (Breslin), the other Brooklyn (Hamill), who transcended their extremely humble beginnings to become masters of their craft and celebrities in their own right. As co-director Jonathan Alter puts it, “They were there for every big story of the second half of the 20th century, between 1950 and 2001.” That included assassinations (the Kennedy brothers, Malcolm X), crime figures (Son of Sam, Bernhard Goetz), urban horrors (AIDS, the Crown Heights riots) and terrorist attacks (9/11).\n\nAlter, 61, spoke to The Post by telephone from New Jersey, where he lives with his family.\n\nHow long did it take you to make the film? Some of the on-camera contributors are no longer with us.\n\nWe started in the summer of 2015. We interviewed 45 people and have one of the very last interviews with Tom Wolfe and Les Payne, the great African-American columnist.\n\nHow did Breslin and Hamill change journalism?\n\nThey personified an era when print journalists could be swashbuckling figures. It’s unimaginable now. Could you imagine a print journalist (Hamill) dating the most famous woman in the world (Jackie Onassis) and a top Hollywood star (Shirley MacLaine) at the same time? Or hosting “Saturday Night Live” (Breslin)? Before Woodward and Bernstein, Jimmy was the most famous journalist in America. He showed that you could write novelistically in a newspaper using facts. Breslin’s column, “A Death in Emergency Room One,” about the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination, blew the doors off journalism.\n\nAs far as Pete Hamill goes, he showed that even if you are a high-school dropout you can educate yourself. His stories are rich in the beauty of the English language.\n\nThey were stars, for sure. But was stardom good for journalism?\n\nJournalism is big enough to have worker bees and queen bees. When I was in high school, Woodward and Bernstein became famous [because of “All The President’s Men”]. They inspired other people to get into the business.\n\nBreslin achieved another level of fame when serial killer Son of Sam started writing to him at the Daily News. How do you think that relationship would be viewed today?\n\nIt was controversial at the time. Now Jimmy would get hammered on Twitter. People would say, “You’re doing this to promote yourself.” “These people are dead.” “You’re not helping the police that much.”\n\nDid either Breslin or Hamill comment on the decline of newspapers?\n\nWe talked to them about that. I think Jimmy felt like good storytelling would find its place. Gloria Steinem sounds an optimistic note at the end. We didn’t want the film to be a journalism seminar. We tried to make it fast-paced and entertaining.\n\nAnd here’s what else to watch this week:\n\nRent | Sunday, 8 p.m., Fox\n\nThis is a live production of Jonathan Larson’s Pulitzer prize-winning Broadway musical, based on “La Boheme.” Brandon Victor Dixon, who stole “Jesus Christ Superstar,” from John Legend last year on NBC, stars along with Vanessa Hudgens and Jordan Fisher.\n\nRoswell, New Mexico | Tuesday, 9 p.m., The CW\n\nAfter uncovering some info about Max (Nathan Parsons), Liz (Jeanine Mason) runs some tests to gauge the extent of his powers.\n\nA Million Little Things | Thursday, 9 p.m., ABC\n\nDelilah (Stephanie Szostak) struggles to keep the house, while Ashley (Christina Ochoa) has a secret meeting with someone who may be able to help. Maggie (Allison Miller) receives a medical update.\n\nWill (Eric McCormack), Karen (Megan Mullally) and Jack (Sean Hayes) unknowingly take a hallucinogenic drug. A long, strange trip awaits this trio.\n\nTrue Detective | Sunday, 9 p.m., HBO\n\nHays (Mahershala Ali) and West (Stephen Dorff) connect the Purcell crime to the local church. As the detectives search for one suspect and round up another for interrogation, Vietnam vet Woodard (Michael Greyeyes) is targeted by a vigilante group.\n\nI Am the Night | Monday, 9 p.m., TNT\n\nSeries premiere. Fauna Hodel (India Eisley), who was given away by her teenage birth mother, crosses paths with a Hollywood gynecologist (Jefferson Mays). Chris Pine co-stars as a Jim Rockford-style journalist who gets beat up while on the job.\n\nThe Masked Singer | Wednesday, 9 p.m., Fox\n\nThe remaining disguised C-list “singers” perform numbers with “touchy-feely clues.” Host Nick Cannon welcomes this B-list panel: Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger and Robin Thicke."

    "news": "VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s chief financial officer, the central figure in a high-stakes dispute between the world’s two largest economies, made her first appearance in a Canadian court in more than a month on Tuesday as Ottawa weighs extraditing the Chinese executive to the United States.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, daughter of the Chinese telecommunications company’s founder, attended the hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court during which Justice William Ehrcke approved her request for a change in who is financially responsible for her bail.\n\nCanada arrested Meng on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which on Monday brought sweeping charges against Huawei and Meng that paint the company as a threat to U.S. national security. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.\n\n“I can confirm that the United States has filed a formal request with my department for the extradition of Ms. Meng,” Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters in Ottawa.\n\nCanada’s government now has a month to decide whether the U.S. extradition request is strong enough to be presented in the British Columbia court. Lametti, asked whether a decision could come sooner than 30 days, said officials “will take the time that they need to make an enlightened decision based on the evidence in front of them.”\n\nNeither Lametti nor Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland gave any hints on whether Canada would back the extradition request. Freeland told reporters Meng “has been afforded access to Canada’s impartial and objective judicial system.”\n\nEhrcke on Dec. 11 approved Meng’s release on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail, and she has stayed at a family residence in Vancouver. Canada’s government agreed to her request concerning bail at Tuesday’s hearing, which the judge granted. Ehrcke also postponed Meng’s next scheduled court appearance by a month, to March 6, which comes after the 30-day extradition decision deadline.\n\nBefore the hearing, Meng, who is fighting extradition, spoke with her lawyer David Martin, holding a notepad.\n\nHer arrest further aggravated U.S.-Chinese tensions at a time when the two economic powerhouses are locked in a trade war. President Donald Trump said in December he could intervene in Meng’s case if it would serve U.S. national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.\n\nFollowing Meng’s arrest, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds. A Chinese court later retried a Canadian man who had been jailed for drug smuggling and sentenced him to death.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday fired his ambassador to China, who had said Meng could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States.\n\n‘A HOSTAGE’\n\nIn a previous sworn affidavit, Meng said she is innocent and would contest the allegations at trial in the United States if she is extradited. Her lawyer Reid Weingarten said Meng “should not be a pawn or a hostage” in “complex” Sino-U.S. relations.\n\nHuawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones. It derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China.\n\nIn Ottawa, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Canada’s decision on whether to ban Huawei from supplying equipment to 5G networks is “some ways off into the future.”\n\nGoodale’s comments were the most specific indication yet from Ottawa on the timing of the politically sensitive announcement. Officials are studying the security implications of 5G networks, the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. The United States and other Canadian allies have already imposed restrictions on Huawei equipment, citing the risk of espionage.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday he expected significant progress in Washington trade talks with Chinese officials, set for Wednesday and Thursday. Mnuchin said the U.S. security concerns raised by the Huawei case were separate from the trade issue.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry has urged the United States to drop the arrest warrant against Meng and end “unreasonable suppression” of Chinese companies. China has demanded the executive’s immediate release.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd`s chief financial officer (CFO), is seen in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters December 6, 2018. Huawei/Handout via REUTERS\n\nHuawei’s global reach has come under attack from the United States, which is trying to prevent U.S. companies from buying Huawei equipment and is pressing allies to do the same. U.S. security experts are worried the gear could be used by China’s government for espionage, a concern Huawei calls unfounded.\n\nU.S. intelligence and national security officials expressed fresh national security concerns about Huawei during a U.S. Senate committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers the lines between “the Chinese government and ostensibly private companies” are blurred if not totally erased and “especially the lines between lawful behavior and fair competition and lying and hacking and cheating and stealing.”"
