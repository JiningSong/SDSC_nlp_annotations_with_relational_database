      "news": "If you ask City Manager T.C. Broadnax or Police Chief U. Renee Hall about crime in Dallas, they’ll tell you that major crimes are down. But as we peruse the city’s own database two deadly crimes stand out: weapons and drugs.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Dallas Police Department’s weekly report to City Council members, weapons violations citywide are up 69 percent so far this year. Drug and narcotics offenses are up 57 percent.\n\nWhat brought these statistics onto our radar was the arrest Saturday of Rene Eduardo Montanez Jr. on a capital murder charge in the death of Joseph Anthony Pintucci, an 18-year-old former Highland Park High School student. Police describe the incident as a drug deal gone bad in a parking garage. Pintucci’s death has drawn a great deal of attention, but a quick review of this newspaper’s files reveal many other such drug-related acts of violence.\n\nHere are the details as we know them about Pintucci’s shooting last week at the Shops at Park Lane. Police said he had used a social media app to arrange a drug sale, according to an arrest-warrant affidavit. He was in his car with two other people when Montanez and two men pulled guns and stole the drugs from him, according to the affidavit. One of the men shot Pintucci, who later died, as the trio fled on foot, the affidavit says."

      "news": "The longest government shutdown in our country’s history has ended, at least temporarily. Over the next three weeks, lawmakers must reach principled agreement to fund the entire federal government and keep it open.\n\nUnfortunately, this sad episode is a warning sign of equally difficult circumstances ahead in the new Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi appear to have irreconcilable differences. As a result of their intransigence, dedicated civil servants were furloughed or required to work without pay for more than a month. In addition, the strongest democratic country in the world has suffered a black eye to its global credibility.\n\nAs the staff director of the Senate Budget Committee during the 1995-96 government shutdown — the longest, prior to this one — I remember only too well how it ended: Republicans gave in to President Bill Clinton and abandoned their goal of enacting a plan to balance the federal budget over a seven-year period. The irony that the current shutdown relates to spending more money, with a nearly trillion-dollar deficit expected this year, is not lost on some of us.\n\nEven though Republicans conceded to the president in 1996, they were able to successfully negotiate in the following months the most fundamental reforms to our welfare system in decades. Equally important, Republicans and Democrats came together the following year — without shutting down the government — to enact the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that led to federal budget surpluses for four straight years until the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe latest shutdown has been a lesson in how each side needs something to claim victory. But that has always been the backbone of a successful negotiation, and in this instance, both congressional leaders have spent plenty of time in their careers around a negotiating table to know that. In other words, they know better.\n\nSo what will follow a shutdown that has marked such a contentious period between Republicans and Democrats?\n\nWill a divided 116th Congress and a determined president return to addressing the issues of most concern to the American public: prescription drug prices; economic, retirement, and job security; fixing the country’s infrastructure; the cost of higher education; and just maybe, the increasing imbalance between revenue and spending? One can only hope for a return to a functioning democratic, deliberative process addressing these and other pressing issues.\n\nSign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nBut the unfortunate truth is that the end of the longest shutdown in our history may only be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what lies ahead.\n\nCongress must again turn to its most fundamental responsibility of adopting a budget blueprint to guide its spending and revenue decisions for next year. The president has the first shot at this blueprint and is required to submit his budget to Congress for fiscal 2020 by Feb. 4. If that submission is delayed, it would once again jeopardize Congress’ ability to complete its annual appropriation bills by the end of September.\n\nThe reinstatement of the currently suspended statutory debt limit after March 1 could trigger a real “fiscal cliff” — probably even more serious than the recent government shutdown. Past administrations have used authorized special procedures to stretch out the country’s borrowing authority beyond the statutory suspension date.\n\nBut the president, possibly thwarted by not achieving his border wall in this shutdown, could look again for leverage with Congress by not implementing these extraordinary measures and holding hostage the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. That would set off a disastrous, unprecedented government default on March 2.\n\nFinally, the statutory caps for fiscal 2020 defense and nondefense appropriations fall back from their current 2019 levels by more than $125 billion. On Oct. 1, defense spending would decline $71 billion and nondefense by $54 billion. A similar cliffhanger in 2018 resulted in the caps being adjusted upward. How will the 116th Congress choose to modify these caps for their upcoming appropriations?\n\nThis shutdown has ended, for now. But do not assume we won’t see reruns of this horror show unless, as James Madison understood at our founding, politicians compromise because they have to, not because they want to.\n\nG. William Hoagland is a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center is a D.C.-based think tank that actively promotes bipartisanship. BPC works to address the key challenges facing the nation through policy solutions that are the product of informed deliberations by former elected and appointed officials, business and labor leaders, and academics and advocates from both ends of the political spectrum.

      "news": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - Antroinette Worsham’s oldest daughter, Antavia, died of diabetes complications after she turned 21 and was no longer eligible for an Ohio Department of Health program that subsidized the cost of the insulin she needed to survive, which cost $333 per month.\n\nWearing a red “Patients over Profit$” T-shirt, the Cincinnati mom on Tuesday implored the House Oversight and Reform Committee to crack down on pharmaceutical price gouging before the same thing happens to her 18-year-old daughter, Antanique, who also has diabetes. She fears that her second daughter won’t be able to afford her insulin on top of the high cost of her college tuition, room and board.\n\n“We want to save more lives,” Worsham told a committee hearing on soaring prescription drug prices. ”It can be done. And you are the people to make it happen. I am just the voice for people.”\n\nAccording to an analysis by AARP, approximately 94 percent of widely used brand-name drugs more than doubled in price between 2005 and 2017. The organization said prescription drug costs rose an average of 8.4 percent in 2017—four times the rate of inflation. The American Diabetes Association says the average cost of insulin – which more than 7 million require to stay alive – has nearly tripled since 2002.\n\nThe chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings, has asked 12 major drug makers to give his committee information on their price increases, research investments and strategies to preserve market share and pricing power. He said he hopes his investigation will determine why drug companies are increasing prices so dramatically, how they’re using the proceeds, and how to reduce prices.\n\n“I am going to paint Ms. Worsham’s face in the DNA of every cell of my brain to try to make sure that her other daughter who is facing the same thing does not die,” Cummings said.\n\nHolmes County GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs said he wanted to make sure any changes don’t overregulate or reduce incentives for drug development.\n\nThe committee’s top Republican, Champaign County Rep. Jim Jordan, said he was concerned that Cummings launched the investigation without consulting him and that it was done “to score political points” instead of get answers. He described “Democrats` last idea for fixing health care, Obamacare,” as a “disaster we will be repairing for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nNonetheless, he said prescription drug prices are an important issue, and he expressed hope work would proceed on a bipartisan basis.\n\n“We will never succeed in delivering reforms to the American people if all possible solutions are not on the table,” said Jordan.\n\nMedical experts at the House hearing said drug companies keep drug prices high by keeping generic competitors out of the market and trying to extend their patents on medications by making slight tweaks to their composition.\n\nThey said insulin prices might be brought down if the government or nonprofit drug companies could produce old formulations of the drug that works for many patients.\n\n“This is such a widespread problem,” said Harvard Medical School Professor Aaron S. Kesselheim.\n\nThe high price of insulin and other drugs was also the focus of a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday. Its chairman, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, vowed to “get to the bottom of the insulin price problem,” and said he’s heard from seniors who have seen their prescription drug costs increase every month “for no apparent reason.”\n\n“We need to continue to have a strong research engine to develop new treatments, but we must also have a discussion about the affordability of these drugs,” said Grassley.\n\n."

      "news": "CLEVELAND, Ohio — Eleven people, led by a Brazilian man, participated in an operation that mailed pieces of paper infused with synthetic opioids and other drugs to inmates in federal prisons across the country, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Cleveland said Tuesday.\n\nThe organization, which operated from 2015 to last year, used a chemical process to soak the paper in drugs obtained from China, according to a grand jury indictment. The paper was designed to be cut into strips and smoked.\n\nIn order to avoid detection, members disguised the paper as legitimate correspondence, such as letters from attorneys, funeral announcements and books, according to the 19-count indictment and an affidavit unsealed Tuesday. The organization used gangs, including the Latin Folks and G27, to deal the drugs in prison, the affidavit states.\n\nExactly how many inmates received the drug-infused papers was unclear. The affidavit, sworn out in March by FBI agent H. Douglas Williams, said authorities estimated more than 145 inmates in more than 50 federal prisons across the country were co-conspirators. That does not include other inmates the co-conspirators dealt to in prison, the affidavit says.\n\nMembers of the organization laundered the proceeds of their business, the indictment states.\n\nThe FBI says it was all led by Roy Kahn, a 48-year-old who was born in Brazil, once lived in Florida and is believed to have returned to his native country.\n\nMost of the defendants live outside Ohio, and six of them are currently in federal prison, prosecutors say. However, the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office in Cleveland took the lead on the investigation following a discovery when arresting Euclid man Irwin Vargas in a separate drug case.\n\nKahn has been wanted since March 30 on an arrest warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge. The criminal complaint and Williams` affidavit were sealed until Tuesday, when the grand jury handed up its indictment.\n\nThe indictment says Kahn and co-defendant Christopher Adams devised the process to infuse paper with drugs. At the height of their operation, they infused more than two pounds of drugs a week, resulting in at least 500 pieces of paper at a time.\n\nThe letters they sent to inmates included the names of real and fake attorneys. For the fake ones, members created websites to make the letters and names appear legitimate, prosecutors said.\n\nThe group also disguised the drugs in photographs, books and pamphlets, including Harry Potter-themed coloring books with the illicit parchment, according to prosecutors.\n\nInmates paid Kahn, Vargas and others through the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ payment system, money orders, wire transfers and mailed cash, prosecutors claim. They charged at least $500 for a sheet of paper, authorities say.\n\nIn addition to laundering the money, Kahn also bought more Chinese drugs and had them shipped all over the country, including Cleveland, the U.S. Attorney’s Office says.\n\nThe case against Kahn, Vargas and others expanded following Vargas’ arrest in December 2017 as part of a large-scale drug bust that resulted in charges against 26 people.\n\nAuthorities said Vargas and Isidoro Gonzalez ran a drug ring where the group obtained heroin, fentanyl, cocaine and the synthetic opioid U-47700 from Puerto Rico and sold the drugs throughout Cleveland and Toledo. The groups laundered money through car repair shops, wire transfers and by depositing small amounts of money into ATMS, court records show.\n\nTuesday’s indictment says federal agents found a partial drug ledger belonging to Vargas that contained the names of inmates to whom Kahn’s organization sold drug-infused papers on Dec. 7, 2017, the same day he was arrested.\n\nVargas, who owned Santiago Autocare Services on Bridge Road in Cleveland, pleaded guilty last week to federal drug charges stemming from the 2017 case.\n\nHis attorney David Grant said Tuesday afternoon that he had not yet seen the new indictment.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story, please visit Tuesday’s crime and courts comments section."

Sherrod Brown launches his tour of early presidential primary states Wednesday during a rally in Northeast Ohio before heading to Iowa. As cleveland.com’s Seth Richardson writes, Brown’s chances at winning the nomination in a crowded field hinge on his performance in the Hawkeye State.\n\nFarm harm? Brown could have a tough time selling his position on trade in Iowa, writes Jack Torry for the Columbus Dispatch. Torry quotes David Swenson, an economics professor from Iowa State University: “Iowa grows more soybeans than any other state. At least on agricultural commodities, we seem to be getting hit [by tariffs] the worst. I don’t know how Sherrod sells this message when he comes to Iowa.”\n\nYeah but: There is a 99.9 percent chance Brown, while in Iowa, at some point will mention growing up milking cows on his family’s farm near Mansfield.\n\nOn appeal: A three-judge federal appellate panel in Cincinnati is expected to hear arguments Wednesday on Ohio’s Down syndrome abortion ban. Cleveland.com’s Laura Hancock writes that the state is appealing the case, because a lower-court judge blocked the law from going into effect.\n\nObstacles eliminated? With Gov. Mike DeWine and Ohio Right to Life backing a so-called abortion “heartbeat” bill, a measure could potentially get passed soon and end up before the U.S. Supreme Court, Hancock writes. Abortion supporters warn overturning Roe v. Wade could hurt women, doctors and others.\n\nRunning out the clock: A federal lawsuit aimed at redrawing Ohio’s politically gerrymandered congressional district map in time for the 2020 election faces a potential new hurdle - timing, reports cleveland.com’s Rich Exner. The Ohio Attorney General’s office this week asked the court to delay the March 4 start of the trial until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules later this year on gerrymandering cases from North Carolina and Maryland. Such a delay would “severely jeopardize” efforts to put a more fairly drawn map in place for next year’s election, even if the suit is successful, said Freda Levenson, lead attorney in the case for the ACLU of Ohio.\n\nEven more 2020 news: State Rep. Niraj Antani is expected to announce his candidacy for term-limited state Sen. Peggy Lehner’s seat in 2020. Antani, a Dayton-area Republican, said Tuesday he plans to announce a run for “higher office” today. Both Antani and fellow Republican state Rep. Jim Butler have been eyeing Lehner’s seat for awhile now.\n\nTech travails: Glitches in the state’s new online portal for filing business taxes are causing headaches for some Ohio cities, writes Randy Ludlow for the Columbus Dispatch. The problems led to late-arriving payments in some instances and in others, tax payments that are less than what are actually owed. “Just about every municipality has experienced the same problems. They are kind of universal,” said Kent Scarrett, executive director of the Ohio Municipal League.\n\nMake it stop: After introducing legislation in every Congress since 2011 that would end government shutdowns, Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman thinks the recently ended 35-day shutdown has generated enough consensus on the issue to pass his bill, cleveland.com’s Sabrina Eaton reports. He says he hopes it will be included in the deal that’s negotiated to fund the government for the rest of 2019 and make border security improvements. “Finally, there is a sense that we are tired of this and we want to see something different,” Portman said.\n\nA mother’s plea: An Ohio mom on Tuesday urged the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to reduce prescription drug costs. Antroinette Worsham of Cincinnati described how her daughter died of diabetes complications because she couldn’t afford the insulin needed to stay alive, and said she feared the same fate for a younger daughter. “We want to save more lives,” Worsham told the committee, which, Eaton reports, is examining ways to cut drug costs.\n\nA comeback? Don Plusquellic, the former longtime mayor of Akron, is considering running again for his old job, write Betty Lin-Fisher and Doug Livingston for the Akron Beacon Journal. Plusquellic, first elected Akron’s mayor in 1987, unexpectedly resigned from the position in 2015. Current Mayor Dan Horrigan didn’t mince words when asked about the possible challenge, saying in part that Plusquellic’s “bitterness and stale, personal feuds” with myriad actors \"unfortunately poisoned his ability to lead the city into its a new chapter of growth and prosperity.”\n\nFull Disclosure\n\nHere are 5 things we learned from the March 21, 2018 financial disclosure of state Sen. Cecil Thomas, a Cincinnati Democrat:\n\n1. Besides his $69,137 legislative salary, he disclosed making $25,000 to $49,999 from a pair of rental properties, as well as $25,000 to $49,999 from the pension he receives as a retired police officer.\n\n2. He has no personal investments, other than his police and state pensions.\n\n3. At some point during 2017, he owed at least $1,000 to Wells Fargo Mortgage, Fidelity Mortgage, the Cincinnati Police Federal Credit Union, American Express, Great Lakes Borrowers, Home Depot Credit, Synchrony Bank, Visa Credit Card and the Cincinnati Federal Credit Union.\n\n4. He received $4,434.56 in Senate travel reimbursements.\n\n5.
