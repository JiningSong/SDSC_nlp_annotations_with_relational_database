But as we peruse the city’s own database two deadly crimes stand out: weapons and drugs.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Dallas Police Department’s weekly report to City Council members, weapons violations citywide are up 69 percent so far this year. Drug and narcotics offenses are up 57 percent.\n\nWhat brought these statistics onto our radar was the arrest Saturday of Rene Eduardo Montanez Jr. on a capital murder charge in the death of Joseph Anthony Pintucci, an 18-year-old former Highland Park High School student. Police describe the incident as a drug deal gone bad in a parking garage. Pintucci’s death has drawn a great deal of attention, but a quick review of this newspaper’s files reveal many other such drug-related acts of violence.\n\nHere are the details as we know them about Pintucci’s shooting last week at the Shops at Park Lane. Police said he had used a social media app to arrange a drug sale, according to an arrest-warrant affidavit. He was in his car with two other people when Montanez and two men pulled guns and stole the drugs from him, according to the affidavit. One of the men shot Pintucci, who later died, as the trio fled on foot, the affidavit says."
