4901252,"Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) warned of China`s growing influence in the Middle East and Africa and that the U.S. is ""falling behind"" while the Asian nation is ""overtaking us in every way."" Ryan also said the U.S. isn`t ""even acting like we are in a competition with them.""



""China is coming at us,"" Ryan said Wednesday on Hewitt`s nationally-syndicated radio program. ""They are in Africa. They are locking down long-term deals in Africa for raw materials. They’re building islands in the South China Sea. They’ve got very detailed, long-term programs like their One Belt, One Road, where they’re connecting Asia to the Middle East.""



Transcript, via Hugh Hewitt Show:













HUGH HEWITT, HOST: I’m joined by my friend, Congressman Tim Ryan from the great state of Ohio, from Niles and Warren, in fact. Congressman, are you in The Land? Or are you back inside the Beltway…uh oh, Congressman Ryan, are you on…



REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): I’m in The Land.



HH: Oh, good. You should be back here. Don’t you have first day at work tomorrow?



TR: Yeah, I’ll be there tonight late.



HH: All right. First question, Ohio State last night, you’ve got to say they should have been in the Final Four, don’t you think?



TR: There’s no doubt about it, no doubt about it. I mean, you know, when you watch even the Georgia game and how they played last night, you think Ohio State’s got to be there. I think they need to move to a bigger tournament. They need to move to at least an 8-team playoff.



HH: That is, they just got screwed, and they looked good last night. They laid off a little bit in the second half, but they still looked good. And the Browns, Congressman, I have to think this is the first time you and I have felt optimistic about our club in a long time.



TR: Unbelievable. I mean, Baker, Baker, Money Maker. I’m so pumped. I mean, it feels like I’ve got another day in the week back with my Sundays now, so it’s unbelievable.



HH: There you go. There you go. So that’s next year. Let’s talk about this year. Are you and Nancy Pelosi getting along after your challenge to her speakership a few years ago?



TR: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we get along fine. You know, a lot, we kept it professional the entire way. I mean, I clearly had some opinions that I expressed numerous times publicly, but you know, at some point, you’ve got to start governing the country. And we’re in the majority now in the House.



HH: Now I want to tell people you are on the House Appropriations Committee. More importantly, not only are you in House Appropriations, you’re on the Defense subcommittee. Two years ago, we approved $700 billion dollars in spending, last year $716. The President’s request is going to be $750. Tim Ryan, this is your number one job to get this right. Do you think we’ll get an appropriations bill out of the House that’s near the President’s request and over to the Senate?



TR: I hope so. I think we will. I mean, we’ve got to make the bigger argument, and here’s the problem I see, Hugh, with the 24 hour news cycle that the President gets himself wrapped up in, the constant back and forth, the chaos. We’re losing the larger narrative of our relationship in the world with our allies, our relationship in the world with China, and our relationship with Russia. China is coming at us. They are in Africa. They are locking down long-term deals in Africa for raw materials. They’re building islands in the South China Sea. They’ve got very detailed, long-term programs like their One Belt, One Road, where they’re connecting Asia to the Middle East. They’ve got a Make It In China 2025, where they’re really trying to take over manufacturing in the world. They’re investing hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, wind, solar, high-speed rail. And we aren’t even acting like we’re in a competition with them. And the Defense budget with the technologies that are in there, and look, we’ve got to audit the Defense Department. We’ve got to make sure we’re not wasting money. But we are falling behind in major technologies in weapons systems that we can’t afford to fall back on.



HH: Well, that’s music to my ears. Do your colleagues on the Democratic side, because you’ll be in the majority now, do they agree with you on Approps? And will they agree with you in Rules? And will it get to the floor and get to the Senate?



TR: Well, we’re going to find out. You know, we’ve got a pretty diverse coalition in the Democratic caucus right now. But again, you know, we have got to make sure every member of the Democratic caucus and the country understand this competition. And if you’re in this competition, and China is overtaking us in so many ways, Russia doesn’t have quite as strong of an economic hand as China does, but they are playing their hand pretty well, militarily. And we’ve got to compete with them as well. If you don’t understand that competition, you’re not going to understand the need. One of the provisions we’ve got to continue to push, too, Hugh, is when we’re making things through the Defense Department, when we’re signing these big contracts, that this stuff is made in the United States, that this stuff is made in areas that have lost manufacturing so that the tax dollars aren’t just serving a great national purpose with our Defense industry and our foreign policy and hard and soft power, but it’s also creating jobs in areas that need job creation to happen.



HH: Now you know, the Chinese are putting one ship in the water every single month. We’re not even close to that. Do you think that you’re going to get, do you think the acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan being an acquisition guy is going to figure out how to lay out for the House a detailed set of acquisition instructions?



TR: I hope so. You know, I think really all my disagreements with what’s happening with the government today, I think Secretary Mattis put together really the only comprehensive long-term plan for acquisition, technology, and readiness within, and creating a lethal force within the National Defense Strategy. It is comprehensive. It is detailed. I hope we just continue to execute what he’s put forward, him and his team have put forward, and that includes acquisition. And this is another reason, too, Hugh, I mean, we don’t have to build every sub if we have allies that have submarines, too. And so people say well, what the hell do we need to be friends with this country or that country. Well, if you peel the onion back one layer, you realize well, they’ve got five submarines and they help us in Iraq, and they help us in Syria, and they help us here and they help us there. Those are costs and expenses we don’t have to incur, because we have friends. And so yeah, we’ve got to build more submarines, because we are falling behind. But we also have to make sure we keep those relationships with our allies, because we utilize their material and their weapon systems, too.



HH: All right, last question on this. I don’t think of China as a friend, and I don’t think of them as a near-peer competitor. I think of them as a peer competitor that has not taken military action off the table, nor will they ever. Do you agree with my assessment, Tim Ryan?



TR: I sure do. I sure do.



HH: That puts you in the part of the Democratic Party that I remember as the Scoop Jackson Democrats. When are you going to Iowa next, Congressman Ryan?



TR: (laughing) I don’t have any trips planned to Iowa or New Hampshire, but I am getting invited a lot to those two states. So I may end up making another road trip.



HH: Do you have any plans on making an announcement on seeking the presidency?



TR: I’m going to make a decision in the coming weeks. Yeah, I’m going to…



HH: You’re going to do that on this show, I assume?



TR: Oh, well, of course.



HH: Of course.



TR: (laughing)



HH: You know, California starts voting absentee the same day that the Iowa Caucuses happen, and it votes for 30 straight days, and it’s millions of votes. I’m on in every major market in California. I’m sure curious what do Democrats do about this situation if they’re thinking about the presidency?



TR: Well, I mean, look, this is politics. These are elections. You start and you win. I mean, that, to me, is how you get elected. I mean, it’s not brain surgery. You get elected. If a candidate pops in Iowa, it’s certainly going to help them the next 30 days in the California early vote. And if you can get over to New Hampshire and get another win and get a lot of momentum, that’s going to help you as well. But if looks like from the rumors that there may be two, three, maybe even four different candidates from California, which will divide up the California vote and you know, so that would make anybody eligible to maybe pull something off over there. So it’s complicated, but there, those four early states are going to be key for anybody, especially somebody like me who would come out. I’m not from New York. I’m not going to have all the money or the power centers in the country. So it’s imperative for an outsider candidate to win Iowa and New Hampshire and then keep going.



HH: Is it okay to call you a Scoop Jackson Democrat? Does that, is that okay in your party anymore, or do you have to run from that title?



TR: I don’t know if anybody remembers Scoop Jackson, but you can. You know, again, I think, like you can’t participate in a global economy without a strong military. It just doesn’t make any sense. And if you know, Democrats need to make sure that on these issues of security, whether it’s securing the border or securing our national defense and protecting our interests around the world, especially you know, when it comes to climate, we’ve got to be engaged. And you know, you can’t do that without a strong military.



HH: Let me turn to two local issues. Number one, Lordstown, they took $50 billion dollars in federal aid. You and I both grew up with people who were working on the line or had kids in our school when they were working on, our teachers would work there in the summertime. That’s a death blow to the Valley. What do you hear from GM?



TR: I’ve got to tell you, Hugh, it has been devastating. I mean, you grew up not far from where I grew up in the same county. And to watch these families now leave, you know, we hear about family separation at the border. Well, there’s family separation happening right now in Trumbull County, Ohio, where the dad or the mom has to leave the family to go to Tennessee or go to Arlington, Texas, or go, and they’re literally going to commute and leave the family, because the kids are in high school, and they’re established, and it’s sickening what’s happening. I don’t know what GM’s going to do. I had several conversations with Mary Barra. But this is all coming down to contract negotiations, you know, with the local unions from around the country. And then they’re going to figure out from those contract negotiations which product goes where. And we’re hoping that Lordstown, Ohio is in the mix. What makes you sick, too, look, they got the bailout, right? They got the rescue package which I voted for and supported. And then they got $157 million dollars this past year in the tax cut. And then they cut 14,000 jobs and their stock goes up 6%. Now what’s wrong with that economic model there?



HH: There’s a lot. And I’ll tell you, when you take government money, you don’t do that. If it’s a private company without government money, it’s fine by me. But that is just a pure, that’s a private-public partnership that ought not to screw Ohio. Last question, Ravenna. The missile defense agency is going to have to decide someday about the East Coast missile defense system. And if they put it in Ravenna, that makes sense to me. What do you hear, Tim Ryan?



TR: I haven’t heard much. They’re, they keep delaying the decision. I’m not sure they’re going to keep the program. It, Mattis said he wanted it to go back for further review. This was several months ago. We feel like we have the best option here for the East Coast missile defense fund. Again, this is what I mentioned earlier about spending Defense money in areas that would really benefit to have $3-4 billion dollars in economic impact and 800 full-time jobs when it was all said and done in a region in Northeast Ohio that could really use it. That’s how you want to be spending your Defense money. It meets a national purpose, national Defense purpose, but also has economic impact. I hope that happens. We haven’t heard. Maybe with the new secretary now, we’ll get some word. But I’m hoping we move forward with it, not just to authorize the program, but to fund the program.



HH: You kown, Dr. Griffin, who’s the chief technology officer at the Pentagon, said at CSIS a couple weeks ago, “I think everybody is aware that the last time we really invested in transformative capabilities was in the Reagan era. We introduced stealth fighters, stealth aircraft. We introduced GPS precision-guided munitions, high-data encrypted communications, things that were really transformative.” We’ve got to get back in that game. I think it starts in Ravenna, because we’ve got to be ready to intercept this stuff – hypersonics and all of them.



TR: Yeah, no question about it. I mean, directed energy, there’s a lot of technologies that we’re behind on, and we’ve got to make investments in. And like I said, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, I think most people want to see that those products are being built and assembled and manned and fixed in the United States to the extent we can do that.



HH: Amen. Amen. All right, well, you’re a Scoop Jackson Democrat to me, Tim Ryan, and you’re a Browns and a Buckeye fan, so have a great start to 2019. I’ll see you inside the Beltway.



TR: You, too. Take care, Hugh. Thanks.



HH: Thank you."
5194550,"US President Donald Trump announced the official establishment of the US Space Command on Thursday, addressing what his administration believes are looming threats to the United States`s space-based infrastructure.

Speaking at a White House ceremony, Trump described space as ""the next war-fighting domain"" and that Space Command is essential for defending the US`s vital space interests.

“Now, those who wish to harm the Unites States, who seek to challenge us in the ultimate high ground of space. It’s going to be a whole different ballgame,"" said Trump. ""Our adversaries are weaponising earth’s orbits with new technology targeting American satellites that are critical to both battlefield operations and our way of life at home.""

The Defense Intelligence Agency in February wrote in an unclassified report that Russia and China “are developing jamming and cyberspace capabilities, directed energy weapons, on-orbit capabilities, and ground-based anti-satellite missiles that can achieve a range of reversible to non-reversible effects.”

The US`s 11th regional fighting command, Space Command or SpaceCom, will be responsible for bringing together many of the space skills and assets from all US military branches and have them work under one roof.

The administration sees SpaceCom as the first step in an ambitious five-year plan to establish the Space Force - a new, sixth branch of the US armed forces.

If Space Force gets the green light from the US Congress, the Department of Defense will start a phased process to establish it.

Threats to US space infrastructure have military and commerical implications - and not just for the US.

Commercially, if the freedom to go to and operate in space were disrupted by hostile activities, the global space industry - which Morgan Stanley currently estimates to have annual revenues of roughly $350bn - would have a lot to lose.

The loss of a single satellite from debris or a meteoroid can set companies back by hundreds of millions of dollars and also cost jobs.

“We welcome the Administration’s focus on space issues and space threats, including today’s official launch of Space Command,"" said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA).

""Our everyday lives, our economy, and our military operations - from GPS to satellite weather maps, and satellite imagery used by our intelligence agencies and warfighters - all rely on our ability to operate freely and securely in space,"" she told Al Jazeera.

The Aerospace Industries Association estimates that the US government adds about $50bn to the global space economy each year.

But Hayden also notes that satellites have been integrated into almost all economies on the planet and therefore into nearly everyone’s daily lives.

For example, the US government’s Global Positioning System, better known by its acronym GPS, is used by people the world over to find a particular address with their smartphones. And that`s just one application

Because it is connected to atomic clocks worldwide, GPS is harnessed by financial institutions to timestamp financial transactions.

Under the auspices of the US Department of Commerce, RTI International calculated that the economic benefits of GPS in 10 private-sector industries - including agriculture, electricity, finance, location-based services, mining, maritime, oil and gas, surveying, telecommunications and telematics - generated $1.26 trillion in the last 10 years.

In RTI International’s June report titled Economic Benefits of the Global Positioning System (GPS), the authors claim that a GPS outage could cost $1bn a day in losses."

The Army`s Stryker-mounted laser, built to zap enemy drones out of the sky, just took a major step towards combat.

Artillery soldiers with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment are currently getting intensive training on how to laser-blast drones out of the sky to field-test specially modified Stryker Infantry Carrier Vehicles outfitted with a Mobile Experimental High Energy Laser at the Grafenwoehr Training Area in Germany in recent weeks. The training comes less than a year after the Stryker-equipped MEHEL was unveiled during a field test at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and is believed to mark the first practical deployment of laser weaponry by infantry soldiers overseas.

While the 5kW laser system isn`t quite strong enough to incinerate enemy fighters, it`s a big improvement over last year`s test at Ft. Sill, which wowed with a 2kW rig. It`s also big step towards both the Army`s $118 million goal of fielding a 50kW laser as part of short-range air defense systems (SHORAD) in the next five years, and the Space and Missile Defense Command`s long-term moonshot goal of a 100kW death ray — projects that make up just a small part of the Pentagon`s directed energy aspirations.

The Army has been promoting the living shit out of its nifty new laser trucks, but the location of the new training in Germany is most intriguing. Ever since U.S. Army Europe identified a major SHORAD gap in Eastern Europe after Russia`s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Pentagon has been racing to deploy upgunned combat vehicles to NATO countries as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve.

Indeed, the 2nd Cav that`s testing the MEHEL system was also the first to receive 80 new Stryker ICVs rocking the 30 mm cannon, plus an additional 87 Strykers with the CROWS-J Javelin system, to minimize troop exposure to enemy fire.

Where the Pentagon once envisioned the Stryker MEHEL downrange in Iraq and Syria to counter the ""flying IEDs"" and explosive-laden drones born from ISIS`s frightening ""industrial revolution in terrorism,"" the blows to the terror network in urban strongholds like Mosul and Raqqa, and the recentering of the US military`s global footprint, means the future of laser warfare may be conventional, waged in the crowded skies above a battlespace.

To that end, the MEHEL won`t be the only new Stryker soldiers enjoy in the coming months: The Army is also eyeing the fledgling Stryker Maneuver SHORAD Launcher, or Stryker MSL, outfitted with an Avenger launcher turret that hosts an arsenal of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles.

But in the meantime, those lucky 2nd Cav soldiers will just have to spent their spare time — as Army officials said during the MEHEL test at Fort Sill last year — ""absolutely [blowing] lots of stuff up"" with lasers."
2213402,"As a result, the 40mm cased telescoped cartridges are roughly half the length of other 40mm rounds on the market and are even shorter than the 30mm rounds for the XM813 Bushmaster II gun the Army is testing on its up-gunned Strykers, also known as Dragoons . The beer-can shaped ammunition is wider overall, though. This makes them easier to handle and store within the generally cramped confines of an armored vehicle.

It’s an advanced and innovative design overall, but its primary benefits are in the basic size and construction of the 40mm cased telescoped ammunition. A cased telescoped round means that the actual projectile sits inside the cartridge case with the propellant instead of protruding from the front.

CTAI has been working on the system since 1994 and has successfully demonstrated it in a variety of configurations. The United Kingdom and France have selected the weapon as the main armament for their upcoming Ajax and EBRC Jaguar armored vehicles, respectively.

“I think there is going to be interest to let [the Army’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center] look at the weapon in some more detail,” Rory Chamberlain, a BAE Systems business development manager, told reporters after the live-fire event, according to Defense News . “It’s a mature cannon.”

On March 21, 2018, BAE Systems demonstrated CTAI’s 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon to Army officials at Fort Benning, Georgia, which is presently home to the service’s Infantry and Armor schools. Company representatives and service members fired a total of 80 rounds and the weapon experienced no malfunctions. CTAI, which has its base of operations in France, is a 50-50 joint venture between U.K.-headquartered BAE Systems and the French Nexter Systems.

With its increasing emphasis on being prepared for a high-end ground conflict against a conventional opponent, particularly a skirmish with Russia or its proxies in Europe, the United States Army is adding 30mm cannons to some of its Stryker wheeled armored vehicles and is considering putting that same weapon on upgraded tracked Bradley Fighting Vehicles . Now, defense contractor CTA International, or CTAI, is pitching the idea of arming those vehicles, and future designs, with a larger, 40mm weapon to give them even more firepower.

CTAI’s gun also uses an innovative rotating breach design that feeds in ammunition from the side and then rotates 90 degrees to align it with the barrel and form a secure pressure seal. After the weapon fires the shot, the system rotates open again and new round feeds in, pushing the empty casing out the other end. A computerized fire control system handles the entire process. It can determine where certain types of ammunition are within the self-contained magazine, which can hold between 70 and 100 rounds depending on its configuration, and move them into firing position. This allows the gunner to load specific rounds rapidly to engage different targets.

BAE Systems An infographic laying out various features of the 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon and its ammunition.

At present, CTAI offers six different types of ammunition to go along with the gun. These include anti-tank, anti-personnel and material, and specialized anti-aircraft rounds, along with a pair of training types. The dedicated anti-tank round contains a high-velocity, solid metal dart to punch through more than five and half inches of rolled homogenous armor at ranges of more than 1,500 yards. This gives the weapon the ability to take out armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and older Cold War-era tanks, such as the Soviet T-55, which still remain in service around the world.

CTAI A slide from a 2009 CTAI presentation showing the relative anti-armor capabilities of its 40mm cannon compared with other armament options.

There are cartridges with high-explosive air-burst and point-detonating projectiles for attacking personnel, unarmored vehicles, and fortified positions. The weapon system’s ammunition selection function also allows pairing these effects together in rapid sequence. According to Defense News, during the demonstration, BAE Systems showed how a vehicle armed with the cannon might fire a point-detonating shell into the wall of house to create a hole, before firing a pair of airburst rounds through that gap to kill enemy forces inside. Another simulated scenario involved shooting an airburst round over a main battle tank to blind its optical sensors, followed by an anti-armor round.

CTAI Cutaways of the 40mm cased telescoped point-detonating round, at left, and airburst type, at right, showing how the projecile is nestled inside the propellant in the cartridge case.

The standard mount for the gun also allows for a high-angle of fire, which allows a vehicle armed with the system to potentially engage low- and slow-flying aircraft, helicopters, and drones. It’s also a boon for fighting in dense urban areas, where other vehicles might not necessarily be able to engage targets in the upper stories of buildings from narrow streets below. A dedicated anti-aircraft cartridge filled with 200 tungsten pellets gives the cannon a better chance of scoring a hit and the potential to more realistically engage small unmanned aircraft, a growing threat that both large nation state military forces and non-state terrorists and insurgents are employing with increasing sophistication. It seems hard to imagine that this oversized shotgun shell wouldn’t be useful against enemy personnel in the open, as well. The uniform size means any vehicle with the cannon should be able to fire any new rounds that come along in the future. CTAI has been exploring a number of different types, including precision guided munitions, which might give the cannon a limited indirect fire capability, akin to an infantry mortar, when coupled with the high-angle capability. And with the compact ammunition, the gun’s breech assembly can also be shorter, reducing the overall length of the gun, again an important consideration when it comes to the space constraints of an armored vehicle’s turret. The 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon is similar in overall size to the Bushmaster II and should be able to fit in any turret that can accommodate the smaller weapon with relative ease.

US Army A Stryker Dragoon with the XM813 30mm cannon. BAE Systems suggests CTAI`s 40mm cannon should be able to fit inside this turret with relative ease.

BAE hopes that this detail, combined with the gun’s various features, will make the weapon especially attractive to the Army. The service is evaluating the Strykers Dragoons with the 30mm XM813, but hasn’t yet decided whether it will adopt that combination for widespread use. “From our point of view, Stryker lethality is open,” BAE’s Chamberlain said in a separate interview with Defense Daily. “As much as they’ve got the Dragoon … the lethality and the requirements are still to be decided.” The Army is also looking at options for adding a new gun to the Bradley and has been leaning toward using the Bushmaster II in that case, as well. But if that upgrade requires a new, larger turret, then the 40mm Cased Telescoped Cannon could easily be another option, as well. BAE Systems has the benefit there of being the present manufacturer of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family. In addition, CTIA demonstrated it could fit the larger gun onto that vehicle all the way back in 1999.

And if the company can get the cannon onto those vehicles, it might be able to leverage that experience into a pitch to arm at least some of the Army’s still largely conceptual family of Next-Generation Combat Vehicles (NGCV) with the weapon. This program is seeking to develop an entirely new grouping of armored vehicles to replace existing Strykers, Bradleys, and M1 tanks, among others. The service is still hashing out the most basic of those requirements, but has said that it is actively looking to field manned-unmanned teams to replace existing armored formations. The Army wants the first experimental vehicles – two manned and four unmanned – by the end of 2019 and ready for evaluations by the beginning of 2020. Modified M113 armored personnel carriers will initially fill the role of the unmanned ground vehicles, as they already have in other tests, but the two manned systems will be all-new designs. The goal is for those experiments to inform development of a full company-size fleet of purpose-built vehicle, which would arrive by 2023. The Army wants to actually field NGCVs by 2028.

US Army An artists conception of an NGCV that could replace the Army`s M1 Abrams, showing a larger bore main gun, remote weapon stations, Trophy active protection systems, and what appears to be a self-defense directed energy weapon, among other notional features.

“There is a lot of talk about the NGCV and where that goes,” Chamberlain noted after the So in an unmanned configuration on a Stryker, manned configuration on a Bradley and NGCV, who knows what that is going to be… We are looking at that.” If the Army can keep to its aggressive development schedule, we may start seeing more robust concepts for the new vehicles soon. Depending on how impressed the service was by the demonstration at Fort Benning, some of the proposed designs might feature the larger 40mm cannon. Contact the author: jtrevithickpr@gmail.com"
1101906,"The Office of Naval Research’s much-hyped electromagnetic railgun prototype is finally capable of flexing its futuristic muscles.

After more than a decade of research and development and more than more than $500 million it will likely never see combat.

The electromagnetic railgun could land in a “valley of death” between R&D and procurement.



It can fire a solid metal slug at speeds of up to 4,500 mph, or Mach 6. It can hit targets up to 100 nautical miles away. It’s capable of defeating incoming ballistic missiles and liquefying even the most durable enemy armor, the equivalent of a weaponized meteor strike fired from the world’s most powerful gun.

After more than a decade of research and development and more than more than $500 million, the Office of Naval Research’s much-hyped electromagnetic railgun prototype is finally capable of flexing its futuristic muscles — but despite the swirl of science-fiction excitement surrounding the muscular new cannon, it will likely never see combat, Task & Purpose has learned.



According to interviews with several congressional and military sources, the much-hyped supergun has come under scrutiny from lawmakers and military planners thanks to the Strategic Capabilities Office, the once-classified department created in 2012 to fast-track new tech languishing in the DoD’s sprawling bureaucracy, and develop, as then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter once put it, “game-changing capabilities to confound potential enemies.”

With SCO’s interest drawn to other weapons systems, ONR may end up without the necessary funding to push the exceedingly complex railgun toward a critical testing milestone — a delay that, with increasing budget pressures and the DoD’s shifting strategic priorities, could condemn the decade-long project to an inescapable limbo of research and tinkering far from any ship.

‘They’re simply not buying it’

Over the last decade, the Pentagon has funneled money into the development of several next-generation, directed-energy weapons through the Navy’s Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations: The electromagnetic railgun, which has been in development since 2005 in conjunction with defense contractors General Atomics and BAE Systems; the hypervelocity projectile (HVP), a super dense, low-drag tungsten projectile designed as specialized ammo for the railgun; and solid-state lasers, long-time fixations of every service branch and a near-term short-range missile defense for surface vessels.

As of a Nov. 30 Congressional Research Service update , electromagnetic railgun research was progressing in line with the ONR roadmap that once envisioned installing the co mpleted weapon on a destroyer like the USS Zumwalt by the mid-2020s.

In recent years, however, SCO has turned its attention to the HVP: once developed explicitly for the railgun, the super-dense shell’s compatibility with conventional powder artillery, offering a cheaper and less technically complex alternative to the Pentagon’s incomplete supergun for not just the Navy, but the Army to rapidly equip.

“SCO shifted the project’s focus to conventional powder guns, facilitating a faster transition of HVP technology to the warfighter,” SCO spokesman Chris Sherwood told Task & Purpose.

“Our priority continues to be the HVP, which is reflected in the program’s budget.”

Researchers and policymakers confident on the system’s potential now fear that the reallocation of railgun funding at SCO’s behest will end up forestalling the successful installation and demonstration of a tactical rig aboard a naval vessel.

According to multiple legislative and military sources, insufficient funding for the railgun in the current defense budget will grind any meaningful progress to a halt, condemning efforts to R&D purgatory.

As one defense contractor with direct knowledge of the project recently told Task & Purpose, underfunding railgun now would effectively render the decade-long supergun project “dead in the water” by 2019.

“People at SCO don’t want to fund the railgun because they’re simply not buying it,” one senior legislative official with direct knowledge of the project told Task & Purpose. “They are imparting that priority on to Big Navy, which is pulling the money away from ONR.”

One last push

In the year since publishing the jaw-dropping footage of a tactical electromagnetic railgun demonstrator at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division’s Terminal Range in Virginia in November 2016, ONR has been working diligently alongside defense contractors BAE System and General Atomics to bring the supergun closer to combat readiness.

A second video released in July showed the rig firing off multi-shot salvos on Dahlgren’s 25-mile Potomac River test range. Through massive, repeated pulses of energy over a short period with minimal cooldown time, the railgun managed to fire 4.8 shells a minute, inching closer to the requirements laid out by Naval Sea Systems Command in a 2013 call for demonstrators that could fire 10 shells a minute and store up to 650 shells.



While ONR’s rep-rate demonstrations at Dahlgren represent a major leap forward for the railgun, the system still faces major technical hurdles that make the HVP a relatively inexpensive alternative.

Generating the electromagnetic fields necessary to accelerate a shell to tank-liquefying velocities without chemical propellants requires an energy farm or capacitor base significantly larger than what most Navy surface vessels can generate currently.

Next-generation “ electric warships ” like the Zumwalt can channel 78 megawatts from their generators through its power-distribution network, making them ideal for all manner of directed-energy weapons, but other surface vessels would require a major overhaul of their electrical infrastructure for the “pulsed-power architecture” required for multi-shot salvos.

The crucial railgun component that may threaten the entire effort is the “common mount.” A universal system for equipping sea or land-based platforms with a mass-produced tactical electromagnetic railgun, a 2016 House Armed Services Committee report noted that lawmakers were increasingly worried that SCO’s newfound HVP fetish “[had] left the Navy with a funding gap in developing the requirements and design for a common mount, which is a necessary prerequisite to getting this capability into operational use.” No mount, no tactical demonstrations — and, in turn, no railgun.

Without actually mounting a working demonstrator on a surface vessel, sources say, the electromagnetic railgun could land in a “valley of death” between R&D and procurement that may prevent the ambitious, decade-long project from ever going to war.

As with most technological moonshots, success and failure are a matter of optics: If the ONR can’t show off something with a Tony Stark-level “wow” factor for the military planners and lawmakers who pull ONR’s purse strings, researchers risk letter their political capital on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon E-ring slip away.

“Promising technologies fall into the ‘valley of death’ all the time,” a legislative source told Task & Purpose. “Testing is great, but unless you want to put money into transitioning that tech into an actual weapons system then what the hell are you doing? We’re afraid to take a risk and try to get things moving.”

The railgun’s advocates know the supergun is in trouble. In July, Rep. Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and co-chair of the Congressional Directed Energy Caucus, recommended an additional $26.4 million SCO outlays in the House Armed Service Committee’s version of the 2018 defense budget explicitly earmarked as “transition funding” for a shipboard tactical railgun demonstrator program, the second legislative boost to the project alongside an additional $15 million added to the Innovative Naval Prototypes line item by the Senate, according to an amendment justification obtained by Task & Purpose.

According to the Navy’s 2017 strategic program guide, the bulk of the appropriations already designated under that item line are for developing the thermal-management techniques that both the launcher and pulsed-power architecture require for that target sustained firing rate of 10 shells a minute.

The three-month continuing resolution passed in September offered a brief reprieve for advocates to make the case for an additional millions in transition funding to achieve a successful shipboard demonstration, and as of late November, lawmakers had authorized just $15 million of Langevin’s $26 million railgun amendment, funding the congressman told Task & Purpose would likely boost R&D efforts on the common mount.

“Our Navy must be given the ability to test this weapon’s lethality, range, and power at scale, and it must continue to develop the common mount prototype to take this technology to the next level for a shipboard demonstration,” Langevin told Task & Purpose.

But even though the NDAA is now in President Trump’s hands, the coming appropriations fight looming represents yet another uphill battle for the railgun program, putting ONR researchers who have devoted a decade to the project “in a constant state of stress,” as one legislative source put it.

“We’ll take it,” they told Task & Purpose of the $15 million approved by Congress, “but nobody has any idea what will happen after Dec. 8.”

Changing priorities

Despite the pleas of devoted researchers and congressional allies, the electromagnetic railgun will live and die at the whims of high-level decision-makers at the Department of Defense.

According to legislative and military sources, the legislative uncertainty and ONR’s resulting year-long charm offensive surrounding the supergun are shaped by changing strategic priorities within SCO, which wields considerable clout when it comes to developing next-generation weapons systems.

In 2015, SCO realized that the HVP, originally conceived as a specialized shell of the railgun, was just as effective when fired from a conventional powder cannons like the Army’s 105mm and 155mm M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers and the Navy’s deck-mounted Mk 45 5-inch guns.

A May 2016 report from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment found that large caliber guns could fire an HVP between 10 and 30 nautical miles at Mach 3, faster than conventional unguided rounds.

“We thought railguns were something we were really going to go after,” then-Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work stated at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C. in May 2016. “But it turns out that powder guns firing the same hypervelocity projectiles gets you almost as much as you would get out of the electromagnetic rail gun, but it’s something we can do much faster.”

The potential for rapid fielding across both the Army and Navy proved an alluring prospect for SCO’s mission, one that trumped the railgun’s hype.

When asked about the organization’s priorities, SCO spokesman Chris Sherwood confirmed to Task & Purpose that the office is focused on “developing the [HVP] for use in existing powder gun systems to give the Navy and Army near-term, cost-effective long-range fires and missile defense solutions.” Translation: Why invest in an expensive gun if the bullet alone can get the job done?

SCO has publically emphasize that it’s not abandoning the electromagnetic railgun outright. SCO chief William Roper insisted during a July 2016 conference that months after Work’s dismissal of the railgun, the new focus on the HVP would not jeopardize ONR’s work on the fearsome cannon.

“[It’s] not that we’re not interested in railgun — we are,” he said. “But if you look at the delta between fielding in quantity — we have [more than] a 1,000 powder guns, we have very few railguns.”

But according to military and legislative sources, SCO already squandered a shot at helping ONR achieve its critical shipboard installation milestone. In the internal justification memo obtained by Task & Purpose, Rep. Langevin’s office attributed the cut to transition funding under the 2017 defense budget to SCO, “[the] initial entity responsible for work done on the railgun mount, which they subsequently never undertook, leaving the responsibility to the Navy.”

Budget crunch

The problem of transition funding facing the electromagnetic railgun isn’t totally unique. Congressional budget anxieties frequently kill ambitious weapons development projects; consider the 7.62mm Interim Combat Service Rifle, the extra-lethal combat rifle solicited by the Army to defeat enemy body armor that ended up dead on the vine .

As one congressional source put it, “the greater question of uncertainty is: Just how much priority will the Navy and DoD give on the railgun in the coming years?”

An analysis of the Navy’s 2018 RDT&E funding request by Task & Purpose reveals significant changes in the line items that govern directed-energy systems. Appropriations for Power Projection Applied Research fell from $88.94 million in FY 2016 to $13.6 million in FY 2018 due to a reallocation of funding from railgun barrel testing; similarly, appropriation for Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development fell from $251.17 million in FY 2016 to $205.6 million, although this was partially due to the ramp-down of additional HVP research & development under that specific line item.

This isn’t to say the railgun is now completely without funding — Congress appears poised to fund a new Innovative Naval Prototypes line item to the tune of $163.1 million for a demonstrator, but the shifting funds reflect the SCO’s desire to separate the HVP from ONR’s existing suite of directed-energy programs.

“Money is being put into HVP, and not railgun projects, which is why the two are being split,” as one senior legislative official told Task & Purpose. “We’ve been able to rescue some of this funding, but Big Navy sees different opportunities, and because [the railgun] is a major challenge, they don’t want to explore it.”

As far as the Navy is concerned, the focus has remained on the core of the railgun project: the pure science and research that could, in time, put the futuristic weapons of tomorrow within the Pentagon’s grasp.



“ONR’s intention is to continue working on the system, continuing to maturing the components, and moving towards demonstrating a full-scale 32 megajoule launcher and pulsed power system capable of high repetition firing,” ONR spokesman David Smalley told Task & Purpose, declining to comment on funding decisions. “The S&T has continued to make great technical progress and there have been no show stoppers to date to prevent the Navy from having a railgun in the future.”"
3060475,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia is the main suspect in U.S. agencies’ investigation of mysterious illnesses in American personnel in Cuba and China, NBC News reported on Tuesday.

Evidence from communications intercepts has pointed to Moscow’s involvement during the investigation involving the FBI, CIA and other agencies, NBC reported, citing three unidentified U.S. officials and two other people briefed on the probe.

The evidence, however, is not conclusive enough for the United States to assign blame publicly to Moscow, according to the NBC report.

The FBI said it did not have a comment on the NBC report. A U.S. government source familiar with official assessments said intelligence agencies would not confirm the report.

U.S. officials said in July that they are still investigating health problems at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, and do not know who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses, which began in 2016 and have affected 26 Americans.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told Reuters on Tuesday, “We have made no determination on who or what is responsible for the health attacks.”

Symptoms have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said.

The State Department said in June it brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady resembling brain injury.

Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied involvement.

The United States believes sophisticated electromagnetic weapons may have been used on government workers, possibly in conjunction with other technologies, NBC reported.

The U.S. military has been trying to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, including by testing various devices on animals, NBC said, citing Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others.

Part of the work is being done at the directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves, NBC said."

4381694,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just when it looks like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may restart his ballistic missile testing program, U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed trimming the missile defense budget, as one set of deterrents is delayed by two years.

The U.S. Missile Defense Agency - charged with developing, testing and fielding a ballistic missile defense system - will delay the expansion of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system by two years because of a delay in the redesign of the Raytheon Co-made “kill vehicle” the system uses.

A “kill vehicle” pops off the top of the defending missile above the Earth’s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile’s warhead.

The GMD is a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles based in Alaska and California, and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS.

The expansion of the field of interceptors in Alaska from 44 ground-based interceptors, or GBIs, to 64 had been slated for completion in 2023. But the delay, due to technical issues and not connected to the cut in the agency’s budget, now means that the placement of the additional 20 interceptors will not be operational until 2025, the MDA said on Tuesday.

“The important thing is to get it right, and if we’re going to build more GBI’s, we want to put the best kill vehicle on the top of it,” said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

At the same time, North Korea has been pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program after a summit meeting between Kim and Trump in Hanoi ended abruptly on Feb. 28 without an agreement on denuclearization.

New activity has been detected at a North Korean ICBM plant, South Korean media said on Thursday, as Trump said he would be “very disappointed” if Pyongyang rebuilt a rocket site.

In the budget, the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, saw its appropriation cut by $1 billion to $9.4 billion.

Michelle Atkinson, chief financial officer of the MDA, told reporters, “What you are seeing in ‘20 actually looks like a decrease, but it’s really just the declining funding,” as the agency comes off recent financial injections.

Trump’s smaller request comes on the heels of a significant budget boost last year after several North Korean missile tests.

The MDA projected a budget of $9.2 billion in 2021, and $9.1 billion in 2022, continuing the trend of declining funding.

One Pentagon-wide effort in lasers that could be used to defeat missiles saw investment slow dramatically. After nearly doubling just the MDA’s budget for directed energy from $109 million in 2018 to $224 million in 2019, the Pentagon as a whole plans to invest only $235 million in the technology in fiscal 2020.

Among other proposals included in a recently published Missile Defense Review is one involving lasers mounted on drones - aimed at stopping missiles just after takeoff in what is called the boost phase.

During this portion of the flight the missile is most vulnerable, flying at its slowest speed, easily detected by the heat from its engines and incapable of evading interceptors as it accelerates to break out of the Earth’s atmosphere."

A “kill vehicle” pops off the top of the defending missile above the Earth’s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile’s warhead.

The GMD is a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles based in Alaska and California, and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS.

The expansion of the field of interceptors in Alaska from 44 ground-based interceptors, or GBIs, to 64 had been slated for completion in 2023. But the delay, due to technical issues and not connected to the cut in the agency’s budget, now means that the placement of the additional 20 interceptors will not be operational until 2025, the MDA said on Tuesday.

“The important thing is to get it right, and if we’re going to build more GBI’s, we want to put the best kill vehicle on the top of it,” said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

At the same time, North Korea has been pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program after a summit meeting between Kim and Trump in Hanoi ended abruptly on Feb. 28 without an agreement on denuclearization.

New activity has been detected at a North Korean ICBM plant, South Korean media said on Thursday, as Trump said he would be “very disappointed” if Pyongyang rebuilt a rocket site.

In the budget, the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, saw its appropriation cut by $1 billion to $9.4 billion.

Michelle Atkinson, chief financial officer of the MDA, told reporters, “What you are seeing in ‘20 actually looks like a decrease, but it’s really just the declining funding,” as the agency comes off recent financial injections.

Trump’s smaller request comes on the heels of a significant budget boost last year after several North Korean missile tests.

The MDA projected a budget of $9.2 billion in 2021, and $9.1 billion in 2022, continuing the trend of declining funding.

One Pentagon-wide effort in lasers that could be used to defeat missiles saw investment slow dramatically. After nearly doubling just the MDA’s budget for directed energy from $109 million in 2018 to $224 million in 2019, the Pentagon as a whole plans to invest only $235 million in the technology in fiscal 2020.

Among other proposals included in a recently published Missile Defense Review is one involving lasers mounted on drones - aimed at stopping missiles just after takeoff in what is called the boost phase.

During this portion of the flight the missile is most vulnerable, flying at its slowest speed, easily detected by the heat from its engines and incapable of evading interceptors as it accelerates to break out of the Earth’s atmosphere."
4553028,"COLOGNE, Germany — Naval forces worldwide are pushing the idea of anti-torpedo torpedoes, with varying success, aiming to translate the promises of missile defense technology into undersea warfare.

If it works, the threat to surface ships by enemy submarines could be significantly blunted, changing a trend in naval capabilities that has defense analysts increasingly worried.

Take the Germany Navy, for example, which has toyed with the so-called SeaSpider interceptor torpedo, made by the ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems subsidiary Atlas Elektronik. The company recently disclosed that the sea service`s ships and weapons lab, dubbed WTD71, installed a prototype of the system on a multipurpose vessel for a successful December 2017 intercept test off Germany`s Baltic Sea coast.

Following analysis of the data in 2018, Atlas said it was only now given government permission to publicize the event.

""The full `sensor to shooter` functional chain of a hardkill surface ship torpedo defense system with torpedo detection, classification and localisation (TDCL) and the SeaSpider anti-torpedo-torpedo (ATT) has successfully been demonstrated on a surface ship,"" the company claimed in a statement earlier this month.

The image of a missile defense system for underwater use may serve as an apt comparison to conceptualize the idea, but the laws of physics make for a very different environment under the sea. Most notably, the absence of radar detection removes the option of computing near-real-time flight paths needed so one missile can hit another.

Still, some governments believe it can be done. The Russian Navy, for example, is fielding the Paket-E/NK weapon, a dual-use torpedo that can be fired against submarines and incoming torpedoes. In Turkey, defense contractor Aselsan successfully tested the Tork hard-kill torpedo in a project supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey, the Hürriyet newspaper reported last fall.

In the United States, a similar project appears to have suffered a setback. According to the Pentagon chief weapons tester`s annual report covering 2018, the US Navy last fall suspended the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense system that had been installed on aircraft carriers.

Defense Department testers believed the components — a torpedo warning system and a countermeasure anti-torpedo — were too unreliable to warrant further work. The Navy plans to remove prototype equipment on its aircraft carriers during maintenance breaks between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2023, according to the test report.

One of the key problems in building an anti-torpedo torpedo system lies in reducing false-alarm rates in characterizing objects as enemy torpedoes. Atlas Elektronik believes its SeaSpider can overcome that obstacle by combining signals from shipboard sensors with those picked up by the interceptor`s seeker.

""That`s the main challenge,"" SeaSpider project head Thorsten Bochentin told Defense News.

In addition, the company touts the low cost of its system. The assertion comes as the missile defense community looks for cheaper alternatives to pricey interceptors — directed energy, for example — to avoid being priced out of real-world operational utility against proliferating threats.

Assuming a cost of roughly $2 million for a lightweight Torpedo like the MU90, the SeaSpider is ""easily within a low fraction of that,"" Bochentin said.

The company also advertises the weapon`s utility in shallow waters, like those of the Baltic Sea, a key operating area of the Germany Navy wary of Russian maneuvers there. That is because the rocket motor quickly ignites after entering the water, compared to propulsion systems that have the weapon sink to a certain distance before forward thrust kicks in.

A spokesman for the German Navy declined to comment on the service`s anti-torpedo torpedo efforts, including whether any exist, citing a policy that says all talk about munitions is classified.

According to Atlas Elektronik, the next step involves tests with the Navy`s WTD71 to deploy the SeaSpider from moving vessels. Additionally, engineers want to demonstrate its capability against wake-homing torpedoes, considered one of the most acute threats to surface ships against which there are few defenses.

The contractor wants to have a system ready to field by 2023 or 2024, regardless of whether the German government pushes the concept as a program of record. Bochentin said there are several navies that have lodged requests for information because they are ready to spend money on the technology.

What is still to come, he added, is a military operational doctrine for what has the potential to become a new way of warfare. Just like in missile defense, ""we are aware that this technology will kick off the cycle of countermeasures and counter-countermeasures, and so on,"" Bochentin said.

Atlas Elektronik has eyed Canada as a potential SeaSpider customer for some time. The company announced last week that it had tapped Mississauga, Ontario-based rocket motor maker Magellan Aerospace to advance development and eventual serial production on the other side of the Atlantic."

The Air Force`s Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation office this week issued a request for information to industry partners about directed-energy weapons to counter unmanned aircraft systems.

The request is market research ahead of an experimentation demonstration that comes as part of the Air Force Directed Energy Weapons Flight Plan, which was issued in May by the branch`s secretary and chief of staff.

The SDPE is asking interested parties for information about their ability ""to provide a directed energy weapons system for targeting group 1 and group 2 unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) during a counter-UAS operation.""

The request outlines a directed-energy counter-UAS system that works with existing command-and-control systems and ""may employ a modular structure capable of interfacing with existing weapon system platforms and sensors to tailor configuration to tasking.""

""Proposed systems must be robust and have integrated sensors used to find, fix, track, and target single and/or multiple UAS targets,"" the request states. It expresses interest in command and sensor systems to rapidly detect and identify drones and integrate with weapon systems that can ""interdict, defeat or deny enemy use of UAS through the use of directed energy (high power microwaves and laser weapon systems).""

The document said the Air Force had issued the request to ""explore cost-effective acquisition options to provide this capability starting in"" fiscal year 2018.

""We identified directed energy as a game-changing technology area in our Air Force strategy and pressed forward with developing a flight plan to define what we needed to do to get from the laboratory to operational capability,"" Air Force chief scientists Dr. Greg Zacharias said in a release. ""Experimentation and prototyping are critical tools to help make this happen.""

The Air Force says directed-energy weapons offer precise targeting with minimal collateral damage and low exposure for Air Force personnel and could cut down on the use of fuel and other resources. The service has been contemplating laser-weapon systems for some time.

At the 2015 Air Force Association Air & Space conference, Gen. Hawk Carlisle said the Air Force was looking at something like a laser cannon that could be mounted on aircraft and used against enemy aircraft, both manned and unmanned, as well as missiles.

Carlisle said at the time the Air Force had a five-year window in mind for such a weapon. ""That day is a lot closer than I think a lot of people think it is.""

Air Force Special Operations Command has also considered equipping the new AC-130J ""Ghostrider"" gunship with a laser weapon that could be used against ground targets during raids and other missions. AFSOC chief Gen. Brad Webb said this spring that directed-energy weapons were quickly moving from conceptual to practical.

""We`re no longer talking about bulky chemical lasers, but streamlined electrical lasers,"" Webb said after visiting research labs working on such technology. ""Believe me, this technology is quickly leaving the pages of science fiction.""

The Air Force Research Lab also recently started the SHIELD program, a five-year effort to create high-tech on-board systems, including lasers, to defend large aircraft like the B-52 bomber and the C-130 transport.

In August, Lockheed Martin tested its ATHENA system, a 30-kilowatt laser weapon, downing five drones.

The Air Force has said it would start equipping larger planes with lasers until it was possible to miniaturize them for use on fighter aircraft. Mounting lasers on drones is expected to even more complicated.

The Air Force is currently doing ground tests of a weapon called the High Energy Laser at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, officials told Scout Warrior. Airborne tests were expected by 2021.

The development work being done on laser-weapon systems is focused on increasing the power of existing lasers and introducing guidance systems."
4003876,"Efforts by Russia and China to develop space technologies are challenging US dominance in the space race and threaten to cripple its galactic security supremacy, a new report by the Pentagon has warned.

Beijing and Moscow are eyeing up several different methods to undermine the United States in space, from ground-based anti-satellite missiles to orbital vessels loaded with lasers capable of destroying other spacecraft, said the report published on Monday.

""Some actors are seeking ways to deny the effectiveness of the United States, having witnessed more than 25 years of US military successes enabled by space capabilities,"" the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) study said.

""China and Russia, in particular, are developing a variety of means to exploit perceived US reliance on space-based systems and challenge the US position in space,"" it added, citing examples including jamming technology and directed energy weapons.

Describing both countries` space services as ""robust"", the DIA said Russia and China were able to use their apparatuses to ""monitor, track, and target US and allied forces"".

Outer space arms race

Responding to the report on Tuesday, China accused the DIA of making ""unwarranted and utterly baseless comments"".

""China upholds the peaceful use of outer space and opposes weaponising outer space or an arms race there,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a press conference in the capital, Beijing.

""For many years, China, Russia and other countries have been working hard and trying to reach an international legal instrument to fundamentally prevent the weaponisation of or an arms race in outer space,"" she added.

China, Russia and the US are all signatories to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits its members from stationing weapons of mass destruction in space and only permits use of the moon and other celestial bodies for peaceful purposes.

In 2008, China and Russia presented a proposal to ban the use of weapons in outer space under a new treaty. The US rejected the idea.

Trump pledges `space force`

While predominantly focused on Russia and China, the DIA`s report also claimed Iran and North Korea posed a challenge to the US` space-based systems, citing both countries` ""jamming capabilities"" and independent space launch facilities.

190118144725288

Its publication comes just weeks after US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would recognise space was a ""new war-fighting domain"", adding his proposed ""space force"" cosmic military branch would lead the way.

""My upcoming budget will invest in a space-based missile defence layer, it`s new technology and it`s ultimately going to be a very, very big part of our defence and, obviously, of our offence,"" Trump said last month.

In December, the US leader signed a memorandum of understanding ordering the Department of Defense to create a new organisational structure within the Pentagon charged with overall control of all military space operations.

Russia has warned Trump`s strategy could unleash a dangerous arms race in space."
411888,"What’s the most powerful country in the world? There’s a good case to be made that it’s China.

There are many kinds of power -- diplomatic, cultural, military and economic. So an easier question to ask is: What’s the world’s largest economy? That’s almost certainly China.

Many might protest when hearing this. After all, the U.S. still produces the most when measured at market exchange rates. But this comparison is misleading, because things cost different amounts in different countries.

Gross domestic product is supposed to measure the amount of real stuff -- cars, phones, financial services, back massages, etc. -- that a country produces. If the same phone costs $400 in the U.S. but only $200 in China, China’s GDP is getting undercounted by 50 percent when we measure at market exchange rates. In general, less developed countries have lower prices, which means their GDP gets systematically undercounted.

Economists try to correct for this with an adjustment called purchasing power parity, which controls for relative prices. It’s not perfect, since it has to account for things like product quality, which can be hard to measure. But it probably gives a more accurate picture of how much a country really produces. And here, China has already surpassed the U.S.

If you don’t trust the murky PPP adjustments, a simple alternative is just to look at the price of a Big Mac. The same burger costs 1.8 times more in the U.S. than in China. Adjusting the market-exchange-rate GDP numbers by that ratio would put China even farther ahead.

advertisement | advertise on newsday

In some dimensions, China’s lead is even larger. The country’s manufacturing output overtook that of the U.S. almost a decade ago. Its exports are more than a third larger as well.

American commentators may be slow to recognize China’s economic supremacy, but the rest of the world is starting to wake up to the fact.

This doesn’t mean China’s population is the world’s richest -- far from it. The countries with the highest income per person, in order, are Qatar, Luxembourg, Singapore, Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. But few would argue that Qatar or Luxembourg is the world’s leading economy -- while per-capita numbers are important for the well-being of a nation’s people, they don’t translate into comprehensive national power unless a country also has a large population.

China’s modest per-person income simply means that the country has plenty of room to grow. Whereas developed countries can only get richer by inventing new things or making their economies more efficient, poor countries can cheaply copy foreign technology or imitate foreign organizational practices. That doesn’t always happen, of course -- many poor countries find themselves trapped by dysfunctional institutions, lack of human capital or other barriers to development.

But there’s good reason to think that China will overcome at least some of these obstacles. Economists Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung have a new paper comparing the histories of Japan and South Korea -- both of which climbed out of poverty to achieve rich-country status -- with the recent rise of China. They find that China’s institutions are, broadly speaking, developing along the same path followed by its successful neighbors.

In other words, not only is China already the world’s largest economy, the gap between it and the U.S. can be expected to grow even wider. This continues to be borne out in the growth statistics -- though China has slowed in recent years, its economy continues to expand at a rate of more than 6 percent, while the U.S. is at just over 2 percent. If that disparity persists, China’s economy will be double that of the U.S. in less than two decades.

So economically, China has surpassed the U.S., and is on track to zoom far ahead in the near future. But what about military power? Here, it still looks like the U.S. reigns supreme. It spends more money on its military than China, has a larger nuclear arsenal, and -- thanks to its recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- has a more seasoned fighting force as well.

But that doesn’t mean that the U.S. would win a war, if the two countries fought. A full nuclear exchange, of course, would have no winners. But in a protracted conventional struggle, there’s a good chance that China’s weight of numbers and manufacturing prowess would win out. As an analogy, consider the U.S. and Japan in World War II. At the beginning of the war, Japan’s aircraft carrier force outnumbered that of the U.S., and its navy was far more seasoned (due to Japan’s war in China). But when the war began, the U.S. greatly outproduced its opponent.

The U.S. also had a 2-to-1 manpower advantage. When two countries of similar technology levels fight, numbers tend to tell. China has a larger GDP, more manufacturing output and four times the population. And as its recent advances in stealth technology, directed energy weapons, hypersonic missiles and other areas demonstrate, its military technology isn’t that far behind the U.S. In a drawn-out war, once the mighty Chinese steamroller got moving, it would be unstoppable.

In other words, China is now in a position similar to that of the U.S. at about the turn of the 20th century -- a formidable superpower that just hasn’t yet felt any reason to exercise its dominance. Once the U.S. woke up to the need to throw its weight around, no one doubted its primacy.

China may never make the same decision. It may choose to remain restrained on the international stage, with a modest nuclear arsenal and a light footprint in global institutions. If so, its dominance will remain a lurking, looming potentiality instead of a real and present fact of life.

But I wouldn’t count on that happening.

2147397,"President Donald Trump is looking at sending the US military into space with a newly invented service, the Space Force.

Combat in space is not only likely in a war scenario, but could prove highly devastating for those on earth.

Most of the fighting would likely involve missiles taking out satellites, and possibly killer satellites and lasers shooting each other down.

But a lot of the fighting would be things the US military already does, so many think it’s a dumb idea.

President Donald Trump is ordering the Pentagon to create the first new US military service branch in seven decades to establish “American dominance in space,” and while experts quickly knocked the idea as premature – there’s no doubt that space is a warfighting domain.

As it stands, the Russia and China both have tested missiles that could bring the US to its knees by crippling its satellites.

Satellites power GPS, which powers most civilian navigation and US military equipment. Satellites also time stamp transactions at US stock exchanges. Commercial satellites also relay internet, telephone, and radio communciations. The US, without its space assets, could suffer societal collapse at the hands of its rivals before a single terrestrial battle is fought.

For this reason, experts assess that space absolutely has become a warfighting domain, and one that may soon see lasers on space ships duking it out in a war above the clouds.

How a space war would go down

“If there was a war between a US and a China, for example, each side would likely try to take away the commanding heights of space from each other,” Peter W. Singer, a strategist at non-partisan think tank New America and the author of “Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War,” told Business Insider.

But instead of starships chasing each other in dogfights and “Star Wars” like duels in zero gravity, Singer said that most of a space fight would actually take place on plain old earth, though lasers are on the table.

The US and its adversaries would fire missiles at their adversary’s satellites powering navigation and trade, possibly from traditional land launchers or from ships at sea. The US has plans to streamline the launching of satellites, and hopes any future space attacks can be thwarted by quick, cheap launches of constellations of small satellites.

Singer pointed out that the US has observed Russian “killer or kamikaze satellites” maneuvering out in space in ways that suggest they could attack or block US satellites.

“They also might be using directed energy of some kind to either blind or damage a satellite. That directed energy might be laser, ground based or space based,” said Singer.

The real fighting is still on earth

But much of the fighting wouldn’t be as flashy as space-fired lasers knocking out killer satellites, instead, it would likely take place in a “cross between space and cyber” warfare, according to Singer.

US and rival cyber warriors would start “trying to go after the communication links between space and earth on the ground. They might be trying to jam or take control of the satellites,” he said.

But therein lies the problem.

Many in Congress have spoken out about the proposed Space Force, calling it premature. The Air Force, in its measured language, seems to hate the idea. Singer called it “absurd” and a “joke.” Retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, also a a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, and four-time space-flyer called it a “dumb idea.”

Basically, all the jobs the space force would do are already being done by the Air Force, and Navy, so making a costly new service this early into the space age could prove foolish.

“Yea space is a clear part of national security,” said Singer, “but it’s hard to imagine a better waste of time energy and budget.”"
2941672,"By MATTHEW DALY

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is set to roll back the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s efforts to slow global warming, the Clean Power Plan that restricts greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.

A plan to be announced Tuesday would give states broad authority to determine how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. The Environmental Protect Agency announced late Monday that acting administrator Andrew Wheeler planned to brief the news media by telephone Tuesday on what the administration is calling the “Affordable Clean Energy” rule — greenhouse guidelines for states to set performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants.

Start your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond. Sign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

The plan is also expected to let states relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades, according to a summary of the plan and several people familiar with the full proposal who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the plan publicly.

Combined with a planned rollback of car-mileage standards, the plan represents a significant retreat from Obama-era efforts to fight climate change and would stall an Obama-era push to shift away from coal and toward less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience.

A three-page summary being circulated at the White House focuses on boosting efficiency at coal-fired power plants and allowing states to reduce “wasteful compliance costs” while focusing on improved environmental outcomes. Critics say focusing on improved efficiency would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

The White House rejects that criticism.

“Carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector will continue to fall under this rule, but this will happen legally and with proper respect for the states, unlike” the Clean Power Plan, the summary says. The AP obtained a copy of the summary, which asserts that the Obama-era plan exceeds the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.

Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama.

“This is really a plan to prop up coal plants — or try to,” said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The Trump plan “will make no meaningful reductions” in greenhouse gas emissions “and it probably will make emissions worse,” Doniger said.

Gina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator when the Clean Power Plan was created in 2015, said that based on draft proposals and news reports, she expects the plan will not set specific federal targets for reducing emissions from coal-fired plants. The plan is expected to address power plants individually rather than across the electric grid as the EPA proposed under Obama. The new plan would give utilities and states more flexibility in achieving emissions reductions, but critics say it could harm public health.

‘Truth isn’t truth’: What Rudy Giuliani says he meant “They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” McCarthy said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.”

Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements.

“We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said.

700591,"The voice on the handset says “We are in two-way contact,” and the scientists gathered respond with cheers. The operations team has just confirmed that the spacecraft, OSIRIS-REx, is alive and healthy. It had been buzzing the Earth as planned, a mere 34,448 miles above the planet’s surface and too close for contact, this spacecraft the size of a UPS truck coursing along at 19,000 miles per hour. After 55 minutes of radio silence, it was now singing, outbound from Earth and on a new trajectory to an alien world. The plan had worked: The Earth gravity assist, as it is called, was a success. It is Friday, September 22, 2017. One year ago, OSIRIS-REx launched from Florida for the asteroid Bennu. Spacecraft rarely, however, make direct flights from one world to another. To save fuel, they swing around the solar system, borrowing the gravity of other celestial objects to adjust speed and direction. OSIRIS-REx’s trajectory took it from Earth, around the sun, and back to Earth for this, its second launch of sorts. The spacecraft plowed into the wash of southern Earth’s gravity, flying nearest to Australia and Antarctica before whipping under and up, physics firing it from the solar system’s orbital plane and sending it racing for rendezvous with Bennu.

Once it arrives, OSIRIS-REx will map every meter of the asteroid, record its resources, and eventually grab a sample to bring back home. Bennu is a pristine chunk of the ancient solar system, nudged near Earth over the last 4 billion years by happenstance and orbital mechanics. By understanding Bennu, planetary scientists can get a grip on how a swirling cloud of dust and gas could coalesce into a solar system capable of creating life. Our solar system is only 4.6 billion years old; Bennu, then, is like a wormhole to the beginning of us. * * * Here at the Michael Drake Building of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, voices from spacecraft operations continue conversing across the VOCA (the Voice Operational-Communications Assembly, a sort of secure phone for teams to talk), and Estelle Church, the team’s science-systems engineer here temporarily from Lockheed Martin, turns to her computer. The spacecraft dashboard on-screen begins populating with updated telemetry data. Temperatures, currents, voltages, instrument states—down the line, everything is nominal. Church works alongside Sara Knutson, the mission’s lead science-operations engineer, who is overseeing the science side of the maneuver. There was practically zero chance that the spacecraft might be destroyed or auger into the Earth during the gravity assist: The laws of physics would not have allowed it. But the onboard computer might have announced an anomaly, or the spacecraft itself might have gone into “safe mode” (in the same way that desktop computers can at home), leaving engineers to puzzle together what happened. OSIRIS-REx could rewrite the history of the solar system. In space exploration, everything builds on what has come before. When OSIRIS-REx flew by the Earth, all of its instruments were switched off, preventing any data collection in the moments of passing. The instruments didn’t have to be off, but back when NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which is now circling Jupiter, performed its own Earth gravity assist in 2013, it swept Terra with its science payload plugging away. Its computer got tripped up, and the spacecraft went to sleep. Juno wasn’t hotdogging with its flyby—opportunistic science is part of every space mission—and the spacecraft did recover, but a lesson was learned. OSIRIS-REx kept its complement cold for its brief dance with Earth’s gravity, and would study our home only afterward.

Now, with Earth growing smaller by the second for the speeding spacecraft, the scientists are free to reactivate the instruments to commence a science-observation campaign. They warm up its instruments and train them on the Earth for calibration and data collection. Our planet is perfect for this, because scientists have a solid grip on its fundamentals. If there are odd variations between known Earth data and those collected by OSIRIS-REx, the instrument teams can make adjustments accordingly. Perhaps the most exciting science to be performed today involves the camera. The team hopes to get a clear “pale-blue dot” shot of the Earth. OSIRIS-REx will arrive at Bennu next August, which means less than one year remains for the team to refine their processes and learn their instruments not as simulations, but as functioning machines of science. For 13 years now, they have attempted to think through and rehearse every contingency, and cultivate a solid workflow for science and operations. Dante Lauretta, who leads the mission as its principal investigator and who, along with the late Michael Drake of the University of Arizona, conceived the mission and made it a reality, says that if every policy, procedure, and lesson learned were printed out, it would be millions of pages long. And yet Bennu remains inscrutable, a wholly uncooperative celestial object. Nobody knows what, exactly, they will find there. Scientists have the broad strokes, following a rigorous astronomical campaign: They understand its density, rotation, and size (its diameter is about the height of the Empire State Building). It is known to be a carbon-rich. But the asteroid’s Wikipedia entry is shorter even than that of Asteroids, the arcade game from 1979. Even Bennu’s shape remains a mystery. It appears from telescopes to look vaguely like a walnut, but some screwy surprise could scrap shelves of strategy.

Lauretta has built into the arrival phase of the mission a “regrouping” period, so that the team will have time to step back and take in this entirely new and inscrutable object. This has to be done right. NASA scientists have never before had an opportunity to grab a boxful of the primitive solar system and bring it back home. Conceivably, OSIRIS-REx could rewrite the history of the solar system and help explain the mystery of the origin of life. If the mission fails, it might be decades, if ever, before NASA attempts a repeat. * * * Hours after the Earth gravity assist, the hallways of the Michael Drake Building feel like an Aaron Sorkin movie. Mounted to a wall in the lobby is a digital countdown clock labeled TIME UNTIL EARTH GRAVITY ASSIST. Just after launch last year, it read 374 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 59.9 seconds. It now reads 000 00 00 00.0. When team members aren’t working, they’re walking and talking or huddled in hallways and doorways discussing the flyby. The images. Prospects and possibilities for the data returned. What might we learn about this third planet from the sun? some joke. Is it habitable? Will there be water? But the spacecraft might indeed return usable earth-science data. The only question presently answerable is whether or not the team will come into the office after midnight and set about studying the data, or wait for more civilized hours of the morning. The scientists seem galvanized by the prospects of doing real science with a real spacecraft and an instrument payload that they conceived and carried to construction. “There is some unknown unknown, some little wrinkle, that is going to show up.” “This is the first opportunity that we’re going to have to really exercise our software that is intended to do mapping,” says Dani DellaGiustina, a senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “We can use other missions’ data to practice running our software, but the images are a different size, or the images might have different metadata. The cameras are different. This is really the first test of our mapping software that we’re going to have using [the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite] images.”

DellaGiustina is equally interested in what might go wrong, because better to encounter it now than at Bennu. “The thing I’ve come to realize is that there is some unknown unknown, some little wrinkle, that is going to show up. The more opportunities we have to collect data and push it to our software and look at it, we’re going to uncover some things—about camera behavior, about software, about assumptions in terms of data latency or processing time—that we just hadn’t even thought about.” The Earth-observation campaign will also help Lauretta, Knutson, DellaGiustina, and other mission managers calibrate the team. Though they’ve worked together for years, plans today become operations. Planetary-science missions are notoriously taxing. Once at Bennu, the scientists of OSIRIS-REx will be running operations every day for two years on Bennu time, which does not recognize U.S. holidays or weekends. They will at the same time be publishing papers and reporting results. Such a relentless pace can fracture even the most solid and smoothly polished of teams, which makes today’s maneuver a second launch for the group itself as well as for the spacecraft: For the first time, they will use OSIRIS-REx to study an actual planetary object. (The one on which we live.) The next time they do this will be at Bennu. “You can solve the engineering and you can solve the science, but solving the people is hard,” says Jason Dworkin, the project scientist of OSIRIS-REx out of NASA Goddard Space-Flight Center in Maryland. “You need the right people. You need to feed them the right information. You need to give them the right environment, and leave them alone enough to do their brilliant work. People have different cultures and different ways of getting along.”

OSIRIS-REx has a large travel budget to help with this. “Having lunch together is more important than it sounds,” Dworkin says. “There’s something intimate and primal about sharing a meal that allows you to push through disagreements. Being able to have common jokes. These very human things help us in times of crisis.” * * * The question on everyone’s mind today is whether OSIRIS-REx will get a clear image of our home planet. The camera suite was designed for Bennu, one of the darkest objects in the solar system. (It is about the color of highway asphalt.) The Earth and its swirling white clouds, patchwork continents, and azure oceans might be a bit too much. The whole image might be washed out. This wouldn’t be a disaster from a scientific standpoint, but it would be a huge disappointment for everyone involved. On a spiritual level, that first image is everything. Just after 6:00 that evening, a skeleton group of 15 scientists and engineers gather around the conference room table in the ops room (the “doughnut distribution center,” where communal pastries are shared every Friday morning over informal conversations that shape the course of space exploration). Among those present are Lauretta, DellaGiustina, Knutson, and Church. Some are seated, some are standing, the anxiety of the moment preventing any real commitment one way or another. After months of planning, you can’t just dial up from your apartment while waiting for your TV dinner. The images are still on the spacecraft, so Church is monitoring its data from her computer—one of a dozen on the table, some open, some closed—and instant messaging her colleagues at Lockheed Martin in Denver for the status of the downlink. (Lockheed runs spacecraft operations. University of Arizona runs the science operations. NASA Goddard unifies and helps coordinate and manage the mission.) Projected on one wall of the ops room is proprietary software that will receive the science data. It should let us know when the image is ready to view.

“We’re on 25 right now,” says Church, drumming her fingers on her laptop. She is referring to the transmitting dish on the Deep Space Network, NASA’s communications array used to talk with each of its spacecraft scattered throughout the solar system. “California?” asks Lauretta. “Goldstone, yeah.” The room thrums with conversation and undirected energy, everyone sharing inside jokes and old war stories, what it was like receiving the first image from the spacecraft MESSENGER as it orbited Mercury and the first image from Phoenix at Mars. There’s no scientific or professional reason for this assembly: Those present could have connected through secure VPNs at home, or waited until the downlink completed in the predawn hours, or waited until tomorrow for the grand unveiling at a 9:00 a.m. meeting in an auditorium area they call the Pit. But after months of planning, a year of waiting, and a decade-plus of convincing the scientific community and selling NASA, of development and fabrication, of setbacks and scrapped plans and all-nighters and breakthroughs, you can’t just dial up from your apartment while waiting for your TV dinner to be ready. “Okay, it should be coming down,” says Church. Engineering data will arrive first, and afterward, it should take a few minutes for each image to arrive: The spacecraft snapped dozens over a few hours. The energy of the room intensifies, and the scientists discuss camera fields of view and what to expect of this first image. After 13 years of planning, everyone has to know all of this already, but what else can you discuss? The bit counts projected on the wall tick torpidly upward when they tick at all. Church types with a kind of gleeful aggressiveness and takes quick breaths. They exhibit the sort of reverence that causes one to step forward rather than back. The team members break the tension with jokes about colleagues doing Facebook Live (the sort of outreach now part of every NASA mission in recent years) and facetiously ascribe any subsequent personal faults to their newfound Hollywood attitudes. (“Process your images? Yeah right—I’m basking in my likes!”) They discuss Pen-Rex, the mission’s stuffed penguin-disguised-as-a-tyrannosaurus-rex mascot, and how she figures in possible Lockheed motives for slowing the downlink. (“Give us Pen-Rex if you want the data!”) “This is the longest five minutes of my life,” Church says.

The image comes without warning despite our having been warned, despite our having been waiting for more than 30 minutes now. It appears first on Church’s laptop, and we know this because she shrieks and laughs.“Oh my god! Wow!” Though it is on her computer, it is not, for whatever reason, on the massive projection at the front of the room, where it should be. Every seat in the room empties as though a fire has broken out, and scientist and engineers fall over themselves to see what she is seeing. There is a unanimous gasp. On her screen is the planet Earth, real and true. Some spontaneously clap, for our home planet and for the team, and the clapping grows to applause. We have to see it on the big screen. This room of engineers—men and women who built a giant space robot with the grace of a hummingbird—are reaching for the HDMI cable to plug it into Church’s computer, and six distinct hands are trying to help, lifting the laptop and guiding the cable and finding the port, and they’re trying to get it attached so we can see it on the big screen. They’re trying to force it into the USB port, and it is gleeful chaos until the technology is at last managed. The HDMI cable is negotiated, and the image isn’t even on the screen yet, and already there is more applause and cheering, at this technical triumph, we’re doing this thing, it is happening, and the screen is blue and then, at once, there it is. There was no guarantee that all the work would pay off, and yet there Earth is. “Wow, you guys ...”"

3568430,"As investigators conduct a painstaking probe for the causes of California’s devastating wildfires, conspiracists have spawned their own theory: ignition by a secret cabal of nefarious “internationalists,” including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sergey Brin, who seek to run the world.

“There are hidden powers behind these calculated strikes in California,” warns one YouTube video, titled “An Open Letter To the People of California.”

In Facebook forums, YouTube videos and Reddit threads amassing tens of thousands of views, believers swap manipulated images of “light pillars” from the sky — proof, they say, that rural homes were targeted to burn, forcing residents into cities, where they can be more easily controlled by shadowy forces scheming at oppression.

People have long reached for far-flung theories to explain shocking calamities, such as the mysterious “grassy knoll” assassin of President John F. Kennedy and the U.S. government’s complicity in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.

Psychologists say these theories gain traction during times of trauma because they ease uncertainty, provide a platform for personal grievances and focus blame on an outside group — usually a network of “elites.” Suspicions are cradled by the internet, which allows people who share those thoughts to more easily connect.

“Whether it’s wildfires, contamination of water supply or some ‘deep state’ takeover — all these beliefs satisfy the need to make sense of a threatening and anxious world,” said psychologist Joseph A. Vitriol, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University.

There’s a new high-tech twist to the perceived plots behind California’s recent Paradise, Woolsey and Wine Country fires. Asserting that nature could never incite a fire so fast or hot, some conspiracists say images of the light pillars reveal “directed energy weaponry” that emits highly focused heat. Others say fires were ignited by drones or satellite-based lasers.

While believers are split over the precise contours of the conspiracy, they agree that “geoengineering” is behind California’s parched and flammable landscape. The state’s weather is being deliberately altered, they allege. Then aircraft dump “chemtrails” of drying agents, which are easily ignited. Chemtrails are actually streaks of harmless condensation in the sky.

Who’s behind this complex scheme? Conspiracy websites such as Infowars, run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones, claim it is a secret plot by the moneyed elite to make certain parts of the country off-limits to human use and impose control.

Widely shared maps titled “Wildfires line up EXACTLY in the same path as the California High Speed Rail System” offer evidence, the conspiracists claim, that the fires are a plot to move people out of the way for construction of the transit system, key to eventual state takeover.

(The made-up fire maps’ geography is off, showing that San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento were consumed by flames. Nor does the map line up with the train’s proposed route.)

Critics say social media companies have not stopped conspiracy theories from blossoming on their platforms. YouTube says it is committed to tackling misinformation, Facebook removed accounts that engage in “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” and Reddit banned a subreddit devoted to conspiracy theories, but sites continue to host false narratives about the fires in California.

Meanwhile, teams of highly skilled Cal Fire investigators are scouring the rugged terrain of Butte and Los Angeles counties for scientific clues to the fires — evidence that could someday aid prevention. The truth is climate change and poor forest management set the stage for these disasters, say scientists.

But that hasn’t stopped the theorists.

Former Petaluma fire Captain John Lord, who now lives in Lakeport, called the fires an “unnatural phenomenon.”

“The rate of spread is abnormally fast. … In a normal structural fire, there will always be things that are left — porcelain toilets, tiles, washers and dryers. In these fires, everything is gone,” he said.

“Planes released nanoparticles of metals, such as aluminum, into the atmosphere,” he said. “That is a drying agent, and highly combustible.”

On YouTube, a Paradise resident identified only as Cheryl described seeing “a huge corporate helicopter circling over my house … surveying the town, getting ready to grasp it.”

“The abundance of photographic and video evidence of so-called fire damage to both vehicles and structures in clear and conclusive. These November 2018 wildfires were not responsible for some ofthe most catastrophic destruction,” wrote Michael Thomas, editor of State of the Nation: Alternative News, Analysis and Commentary.

To be sure, some conspiracies turned out to be real. Watergate happened. So did the Iran-Contra affair. Unbelievably, the Russian government meddled in our 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But the creatively conspiratorial, if crazy, theories hold special appeal because fires can be mysterious, said psychology professor David Ludden of Georgia Gwinnett College, who studies conspiracies.

Evacuation orders in parts of Magalia and Concow lifted for residents only “And they fit in with an existing world view that we can’t trust the government, that all these nefarious agencies are out there trying to get us,” he said. Internet sharing “creates a sense of security and superiority, of having inside knowledge that others don’t.”

Such thinking can distract the public from learning the objective reality of wildfires, making it more difficult to reduce risk, said Harvard’s Vitriol.

“It’s not just your crazy uncle in a tin foil hat, ruminating about the government,” he said. If the internet gives these ideas traction, “they spread and gain legitimacy, so they’re harder to combat.”"

4792951,"The US Army says it will be able to field combat vehicle-mounted lasers and hypersonic missiles within the next four years to prepare for combat against rivals like Russia or China that may employ enemy drones or their own hypersonic weapons.

The service will begin fielding 50-kilowatt directed energy weapons on Stryker combat vehicles in 2022 and road-mobile Long-Range Hypersonic Weapons (LRHWs) in 2023, Army Lt. Gen. L. Neil Thurgood, director of the Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) told reporters Wednesday, according to Breaking Defense.

The Army intends to field test its 50-kilowatt vehicle-mounted laser, which is designed to shoot down enemy drones, rockets, and artillery and mortar rounds, in 2021, and then a battery of four vehicles will be delivered to troops the following year.

There is also a project to develop a 100-kilowatt laser that could be mounted on a heavy truck. The challenge so far has been generating the necessary power levels.

As for the hypersonic weapon, Thurgood`s office is overseeing the development of a common boost-glide vehicle that travels faster than five times the speed of sound, and which will be incorporated into submarine- and air-launched hypersonic weapons for the Navy and Air Force. The Army announced recently that the first joint flight test of a future hypersonic weapon will be conducted next year.

That test will be followed by flight tests every six months.

The ground-based LRHW will be delivered to soldiers in sets of four launchers carrying two rounds each. The transporter erector launchers (TELs) will be installed on trailers and pulled by Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks.

Soldiers will first be introduced to the launch system in 2021, at which point troops will begin training for the first TEL launch in 2022.

Read more: The US Army wants a powerful cannon that can hit Chinese warships in the South China Sea from 1,000 miles away

The LRHW is one of four priorities for the Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) team at Army Futures Command.

This program is expected to deliver a weapon that can, at very long ranges, target critical strategic infrastructure and fixed site radars, disabling vital components of an enemy`s anti-access, area-denial (A2/AD) system, Col. John Rafferty, head of the LRPF CFT, previously explained to Business Insider.

As Russia and China are also racing to field hypersonic weapons, the Army is planning to spend around $1.2 billion on experiments to counter these capabilities. Hypersonic weapons are particularly threatening not only because of their high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound, but also because they are able to maneuver along unpredictable flight paths, making them nearly impossible to intercept.

Thurgood`s office has been tasked with delivering hypersonic and directed energy weapons.

""We`ve been in a full-out sprint since then,"" Thurgood said recently."

In 1929, a young engineer named Eugen Sänger was living in Vienna and thinking about rockets. In particular, he wondered about using particles of light as spacecraft propellant. A rocket powered by photons, he reasoned, would be extremely fast. It could reach relativistic speeds—at least 10 percent the speed of light and faster—beating, by thousands of times, the capabilities of any other kind of rocket. With this theoretical photon rocket, even large spacecraft could cross the vast distances between stars within a person’s lifetime.

It was a far-out idea that would need huge leaps in technology and significant funding, so Sänger shelved it for a while. But in the 1950s, he began again to puzzle out designs, and in 1960, the Russian popular science journal Priroda (Nature) picked up his concept and published a summary of the hypothetical photon rocket, complete with schematics and a warning. Of major concern: A device that could manage to contain the extremely high-powered energy beam, called a collimator, would need to be made of a material with near perfect efficiency, “otherwise, the energy absorbed by the collimator will instantly turn the vehicle to vapor.”

As we know, photon rockets like Sänger’s remain science fiction. Today, we live in an era dominated by rockets that run on combustible chemicals. There’s nothing that gets us even close to 10 percent the speed of light, or 67 million miles per hour. Using our best current propulsion, it would take about 30,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri, our nearest stellar neighbor—4.37 light-years away. Launching a probe using lasers, however, could get us there in just two decades. It’s compelling math, and it has made Sänger’s theories of photon propulsion an eternally alluring possibility.

Using our best current propulsion, it would take about 30,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri.

And so, in recent years, a handful of researchers and entrepreneurs have seriously revisited the idea, thanks, in part, to the emergence of increasingly powerful lasers. These days, the main approach is to separate the fuel from the rocket: An Earth-based laser array would direct its beam onto a spacecraft, pushing it away at faster and faster speeds.

One popular variation of laser propulsion would use something like a solar sail—a giant light reflector fixed to a spacecraft—nudged along by photon pressure from the sun. But sunshine is to lasers as an April shower is to a fire hose. For speed and efficiency, you want the fire hose.

Over the last few years, NASA has provided small awards to explore the concepts. Young Bae, founder of Y. K. Bae Corp, has won money from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program, and last spring, he released a video demonstrating how a photon thruster would work in the lab.

Philip Lubin, professor of physics at the University of California Santa Barbara, also won NIAC funds to further develop his concept for laser propulsion. Earlier this year, NASA released a widely watched video in which Lubin describes the fundamentals:

Last week, Lubin, Bae, and others presented their latest calculations, lab demonstrations, and proposals for future work in a session at the International High Power Laser Ablation and Directed Energy Symposium in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Up to this point, though, laser propulsion has been mostly calculations and teasers. Without significant funds, there would be no way to build prototypes, troubleshoot designs, or scale up to a practical system.

But this week, the field got a big jolt: The Breakthrough Foundation announced that science philanthropist Yuri Milner and famed cosmologist Stephen Hawking were backing a laser propulsion system to send very small space probes to Alpha Centauri—hopefully in that estimated 20 years. The initiative, called Breakthrough Starshot, would provide $100 million for working out the technological kinks. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is also on the initiative’s board. Lubin and two dozen others are on the management and advisory committee.

So, is $100 million going to make us an interstellar species?

First, it may sound like a lot of money but in the context of space travel, it’s a drop in the bucket. Consider the Apollo program. Adjusting for inflation, it cost about $200 billion to spin up. This money didn’t just fall from the sky. It was deliberately funneled into a U.S. space program that was born of fear of and competition with the Russians—who were getting there first. The Sputnik satellite in 1957 and the historic orbit of Yuri Gagarin, 55 years ago Tuesday, were major motivating factors, and as a result, government funding for the initiative skyrocketed in a way it hadn’t yet and hasn’t since.

NASA still has a hefty budget, but in recent years it hasn’t been spending it on such lofty goals. The pressures are obviously not the same today, but other forces may be mounting. Russia is also exploring the ideas behind a laser propulsion system for spaceflight via laser-powered satellites and Japan is deploying an orbiting solar farm that could beam energy back to earth. And then there’s China, which has been developing high-powered, laser-based weapons for years.

The designs proposed by Lubin and others could clearly also be weaponized, just as rockets were used as missiles before they transported astronauts into orbit. In fact, Lubin has said that his system could not only accelerate spacecraft to great speeds but could also be used to obliterate dangerous space debris, and deflect incoming asteroids and comets—something called planetary defense. It’s feasible to imagine how it could also be used for warfare right here on our own planet.

That Lubin’s laser propulsion system has multiple applications holds great appeal: It provides even more reason to build and test the basic infrastructure. But going interstellar won’t be easy—that’s why Lubin developed a roadmap that starts the project small. One growth trajectory he’s proposed would begin with a small laser array on the International Space Station to shoot down space debris. Then, as the technologies mature, the goals would shift to building a larger laser array that could propel spacecraft of various sizes to relativistic speeds.

The smaller probes are the ones that could get to Alpha Centauri in less than 20 years. (Another potential application is human transport. It’s true that the smaller the craft, the faster it goes, but the concept scales to handle larger crafts as well. Lubin says that this sort of system could be used to shuttle people between Mars, although at much reduced speeds because extreme acceleration is hard on a soft body. He’s quick to point out that the required setup—where one laser is on Earth and another is on Mars, both managing the speed of the shuttle to and fro—would be a “formidable project” and probably wouldn’t happen for another hundred years.)

The Breakthrough Starshot directly leverages Lubin’s roadmap and makes its main goal to deploy ultra-small spacecraft the size of postage stamps to Alpha Centauri. These tiny crafts, called StarChips, play to the economic forces at work in the electronics industry: Moore’s Law—the trend that makes computing power on mobile phones more powerful with each generation; and economies of scale—which allows the price of high-volume goods to be relatively low. What this means is that capabilities of such small crafts will likely continue to improve, and once an infrastructure to launch them is in place, the cost of building and deploying new crafts would be minimal.

Similar concepts apply to laser technology. Just as supercomputers are made of millions of modestly powered computing cores synchronized to perform enormous calculations, the world’s most powerful lasers are made of components from smaller, less powerful lasers. These components are “phase locked,” which effectively synchronizes their energy, so that they produce a single, coherent, high-powered beam with the potential to blast out 100 gigawatts of light. By comparison, your laser pointer, which can cause significant damage to your eyes and temporarily blind pilots in planes, is restricted to a trillionth of the power at 5 milliwatts.

The Breakthrough Starshot’s $100 million would help research teams build prototypes. It would also help research teams tackle potential problems, of which there are many (even though most agree that the physics of such systems are sound). The technological challenges range from building a steady beam that can find the StarChips’ light sails without obliterating the crafts (vaporization is still an issue), to designing robust, highly reflective light sails, to building StarChips that can function well a long way from home, to avoiding interstellar dust collisions en route, to receiving and making sense of the data—images, for instance—sent back to Earth.

So is the $100 million going to get us to Alpha Centauri? It would be impossible for that sum of money alone to be enough to build and launch a fully functional fleet of tiny interstellar spacecraft. The Breakthrough Foundation doesn’t deny it. But the funding goes a long way toward enhancing legitimacy of a concept that’s been fledgling for a century. To truly kick laser propulsion funding into high gear, though, it would require a vast amount more money, coupled with doubled-down attention to the matter. And what would cause that? Most likely, some kind of threat—the more immediate, unfortunately, the better.

2063881,"The White House’s proposed military Space Force would likely rely heavily on existing personnel from inside the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Army, plus a host of other intelligence agencies, experts told USNI News on Monday.

The Space Force was announced by President Trump on Monday. Trump’s directive doesn’t provide mission specifics, but the language suggests the Space Force would be charged with protecting both commercial and government assets in space.

“As space becomes increasingly contested, the demand for the Department of Defense to focus on protecting U.S. space assets and interests also increases. At the same time, the rapid commercialization of space requires a traffic management framework that protects U.S. interests and considers the private sector’s needs,” the directive reads.

But before the proposed sixth branch of the military is formed, Congress needs to approve legislation and the Department of Defense would have to iron out the fine details, according to a Monday afternoon statement from Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White.

“We understand the President’s guidance,” she said. “Our policy board will begin working on this issue, which has implications for intelligence operations for the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy. Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders.”

The Pentagon also has to do the homework of creating Space Force theory, doctrine and strategy, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, dean of the Mitchell Institute of Aerospace Power Studies, told USNI News on Monday.

“Creation of an independent Space Force may be the future, but right now it’s premature,” Deptula said.

The last time an independent service branch was created was when the Air Force was split off from the Army after World War II in 1947. By the time the Air Force was created, its leadership had spent two decades between WWI and WWII developing an air power strategy and new technology. During WWII, the then-Army Air Corps continued to refine and implement strategy and technology.

Today with space, developing military strategy hasn’t hasn’t happened to the same degree, Deptula said. As for the technology required for a Space Force to be effective, it’s still very much in the developmental phase.

“I’m all for missile defense using directed energy weapons in space to take out ballistic missiles,” Deptula said. “It’s a great idea, but we’re not there yet.”

Military planners likely have some time to develop the Space Force theory, doctrine, and strategy, since Congress doesn’t appear close to approving the branch, Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, told USNI News.

“To really create a Space Force you need legislation, and the legislation appears stalled,” Clark said.

At the pace Congress operates, Clark said it’s unlikely that anything more than a broad proposal could be approved this year, and that might be a stretch. At best, he said the soonest legislation could be approved creating the new branch would be in 2019.

If passed, Congress would likely leave the organizational details for the Pentagon to iron out. Maybe some new flag officer billets would be created by legislation, but their job descriptions would probably be developed at the Pentagon. Even determining the rank structure — a Navy/Coast Guard model using admirals, or an Army/Air Force model using generals — would come from the Pentagon, Clark said.

The process used by the Department of Defense to establish U.S. Cyber Command provides a possible model, Clark said. Each service branch has cyber experts, and they were pulled together to form the new command. A new Space Force would likely do something similar, pulling in personnel from jobs with an existing space focus.

“Appropriators [in Congress] would decide how much money, and the Department of Defense would decide what duties would be moved to Space Force,” Clark said.

Deptula thinks the Space Force will be created in the future, but he is not sure the Congress has the drive to create the force.

“We can’t even recapitalize the geriatric forces we have inside the Air Force, so where is this extra money going to come from?” Deptula said."

A model of the UK`s planned new fighter jet, the Tempest, has been unveiled at the Farnborough Air Show.

The UK`s Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the jet could be used with either pilots or as a drone.

The craft will eventually replace the existing Typhoon fighter jet. It will be developed and built by BAE Systems, engine maker Rolls-Royce, Italy`s Leonardo and missiles expert MBDA.

Mr Williamson said the UK would be investing £2bn in the new project.

The hope is to see it flying by 2035.

Mr Williamson said the programme was aimed at ensuring the UK`s continued leadership in fighter technology and control of air space in future combat: ""We have been a world leader in the combat air sector for a century, with an enviable array of skills and technology, and this strategy makes clear that we are determined to make sure it stays that way.""

He added that the UK, currently excluded from the latest fighter programme underway between France and Germany, was not against forming a partnership with other nations: ""It shows our allies that we are open to working together to protect the skies in an increasingly threatening future - and this concept model is just a glimpse into what the future could look like.""

`Direction of travel`

According to BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, the Tempest looks remarkably similar to the current generation of stealth jets, including the US developed-F 35.

Its sleek lines are designed to be hard to detect by radar, but unlike the current generation of jets it could also operate as a drone without a pilot.

It would also be the first British-designed jet to carry laser directed energy weapons capable of shooting down aircraft and missiles.

Aeropace giant Airbus welcomed the new jet programme: ""Airbus welcomes the UK`s commitment of funding for the future fighter project. We look forward to continuing collaborative discussions with all relevant European players.""

Earlier, the chief executive of BAE Systems, Charles Woodburn, told the BBC`s Today programme that the new jet would be some time in coming.

""We already have the Typhoon platform which forms the absolute bedrock of European air defence and that`ll be in service for decades to come,"" he said.

He added that the inner workings of the new craft would start life within the Typhoon.

""The important thing about the new concept is that it will illustrate a direction of travel and many of those technologies that will be embodied in that will first see their service through the Typhoon.

""For example, upgrades on the avionics, upgrades in the weapons systems, upgrades in the radar will be deployed through the Typhoon and will be deployed there and then."""
2091296,"The Pentagon has plans to deploy its first ever ship-mounted laser next year, a disruptive, cutting-edge weapon capable of obliterating small boats and unmanned aerial vehicles with a blast of infrared energy.

Navy officials announced Monday that in early 2014, a solid-state laser prototype will be mounted to the fantail of the USS Ponce and sent to the 5th fleet region in the Middle East for real-world experience.

`It operates much like a blowtorch ... with an unlimited magazine.` - Navy official

Video released by the Navy shows the laser lock onto a slow-moving target, in this case an unmanned drone, which bursts aflame in mid-flight. The drone soon catches fire and crashes into the sea below.

""It operates much like a blowtorch ... with an unlimited magazine,"" one official said.

There are potential targets for the laser in the 5th fleet region, which includes the Persian Gulf, where Iran operates small surveillance drones and is known for swarming and harassing U.S. Navy ships with small, armored speed boats.

Navy researches say so far the laser is 12 for 12 in testing, destroying its targets 100 percent of the time. Officials who briefed the press on the laser gun -- which the Navy calls a ""directed energy pulse weapon"" -- say it has non-lethal functions too, and may be used to send warning signals to other vessels.

One of its major advantages, the Navy said, is its relatively low cost to operate. ""Its weapon round costs about $1 to shoot,"" said Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, chief of Naval Research. Although the unit cost is higher -- at around $32 million to produce.

Still, Navy officials say this is a major accomplishment when compared to the Airborne Laser, the Air Force`s now cancelled project to put nose-mounted lasers on its aircraft. Those lasers cost nearly $1.5 billion a piece.

“This wasn’t demonstrated on a barge. This was on a naval warship. And the performance results were quite astounding,” Klunder said.

There are some concerns with the new technology, however. Navy officials expressed worries with its ability to fire in poor weather conditions and believe the 5th fleet region will be a great test of the weapon’s abilities. It`s also unclear if the laser can effectively take down faster moving objects, such as fighter jets.

Officials also would not reveal the range of this new weapon, describing it as more of a ""close in"" system. Energy levels were also classified. If successful, it will eventually be painted Navy grey and mounted on top of the ship with the rest of the major weapons systems.

The Navy and other armed forces have been experimenting for years with these directed energy weapons -- laser guns to you and me. Such weapons could be the future of warfare.

In April 2011, the Navy conducted a more limited test of a similar weapon, blasting a boat from the water with a laser weapon. Nevin Carr, chief of Naval Research at the time, said this energy weapon would not handle all types of threats, however.

""To begin to address a cruise missile threat, we`d need to get up to hundreds of kilowatts,"" Carr said.

The Navy is working on just such a gun of course.

Called the FEL -- for free-electron laser, which doesn`t use a gain medium and is therefore more versatile -- it was tested in February 2011, consuming blistering amounts of energy and burning through feet of raw steel.

The FEL will easily get into the kilowatt power range, experts say. It can also be easily tuned as well, to adjust to environmental conditions, another reason it is more flexible than the fixed wavelength of solid-state laser. But the Navy doesn`t expect to release megawatt-class FEL weapons until the 2020s; among the obstacles yet to be overcome, the incredible power requirements of such weapons.

Also in the Navy`s futuristic arsenal: a so-called ""rail gun,"" which uses an electomagnetic current to accelerate a non-explosive bullet at several times the speed of sound. Railguns are even further off in the distance, possibly by 2025, the Navy has said.

President Donald Trump is ordering the Pentagon to create the first new US military service branch in seven decades to establish ""American dominance in space,"" and while experts quickly knocked the idea as premature — there`s no doubt that space is a warfighting domain.

As it stands, the Russia and China both have tested missiles that could bring the US to its knees by crippling its satellites.

Satellites power GPS, which powers most civilian navigation and US military equipment. Satellites also time stamp transactions at US stock exchanges. Commercial satellites also relay internet, telephone, and radio communciations. The US, without its space assets, could suffer societal collapse at the hands of its rivals before a single terrestrial battle is fought.

For this reason, experts assess that space absolutely has become a warfighting domain, and one that may soon see lasers on space ships duking it out in a war above the clouds.

How a space war would go down

US Navy ships have already knocked satellites out of the sky. US Navy

""If there was a war between a US and a China, for example, each side would likely try to take away the commanding heights of space from each other,"" Peter W. Singer, a strategist at non-partisan think tank New America and the author of ""Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War,"" told Business Insider.

But instead of starships chasing each other in dogfights and ""Star Wars"" like duels in zero gravity, Singer said that most of a space fight would actually take place on plain old earth, though lasers are on the table.

The US and its adversaries would fire missiles at their adversary`s satellites powering navigation and trade, possibly from traditional land launchers or from ships at sea. The US has plans to streamline the launching of satellites, and hopes any future space attacks can be thwarted by quick, cheap launches of constellations of small satellites.

Singer pointed out that the US has observed Russian ""killer or kamikaze satellites"" maneuvering out in space in ways that suggest they could attack or block US satellites.

""They also might be using directed energy of some kind to either blind or damage a satellite. That directed energy might be laser, ground based or space based,"" said Singer.

The real fighting is still on earth

United State Cyber Command U.S. Air Force/Technical Sgt. Cecilio Ricardo

But much of the fighting wouldn`t be as flashy as space-fired lasers knocking out killer satellites, instead, it would likely take place in a ""cross between space and cyber"" warfare, according to Singer.

US and rival cyber warriors would start ""trying to go after the communication links between space and earth on the ground. They might be trying to jam or take control of the satellites,"" he said.

But therein lies the problem.

Many in Congress have spoken out about the proposed Space Force, calling it premature. The Air Force, in its measured language, seems to hate the idea. Singer called it ""absurd"" and a ""joke."" Retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, also a a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, and four-time space-flyer called it a ""dumb idea.""

Basically, all the jobs the space force would do are already being done by the Air Force, and Navy, so making a costly new service this early into the space age could prove foolish.

""Yea space is a clear part of national security,"" said Singer, ""but it`s hard to imagine a better waste of time energy and budget."""
2210384,"Illustrations of the AC-130J Ghostrider`s laser canon. DOD Ever since the Air Force announced the development of the AC-130J Ghostrider to replace older generations of Lockheed Martin`s reliable fixed-wing gunship, Air Force Special Operations Command just can`t seem to resist slapping more guns on the thing.

In 2015, AFSOC added a 105mm cannon — basically a howitzer normally reserved for armored ground vehicles — to the rear of the vessel at the insistence of former chief Lt. Gen. Bradley Heithold, supplementing the AC-130`s current arsenal of AGM-176A Griffin missiles, GBU-30 bombs, and a pre-existing 30mm cannon — making the gunship the most heavily armed in the Pentagon`s arsenal.

""We`ve got a bomb truck with guns on it now,"" Heithold told Air Force Times in 2015, dubbing the Ghostrider ""the ultimate battle plane.""

While AFSOC only got its hands on its first AC-130J gunship in October 2016, flown from Hurlburt Field to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to test out that brutal 105mm cannon, Air Force officials are most excited about the Ghostrider`s other big gun: a frickin` laser beam.

While the use of high-powered lasers to knock out enemy electronics and destroy infrastructure was always part of the mix in the Ghostrider`s development, a new report from National Defense magazine says the ""directed energy weapon"" is ""rapidly moving"" from science fiction to practical integration with an aircraft at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. AFSOC officials are amped.From National Defense:

Using a high-energy laser, he aims and shoots at an electrical transformer, the engine of a pick-up truck, communication equipment stacked near the compound`s front door, and a drone sitting in the courtyard.

""Without the slightest bang, whoosh, thump, explosion, or even aircraft engine hum, four key targets are permanently disabled. The enemy has no communications, no escape vehicle, no electrical power and no retaliatory"" intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability, said Lt. Gen. Brad Webb, commander of Air Force Special Operations Command, as he relayed the story.

""Minutes later, the team emerges from the compound, terrorist mastermind in hand. A successful raid,"" he said.

The AC-130J taking off. U.S. Air Force

""We`re no longer talking about bulky chemical lasers, but streamlined electrical lasers,"" Webb told National Defense. ""These pioneering scientists have honed the ability to combine smaller lasers into a finely-tuned, exquisite single laser. Beam control seems to no longer be an issue. Nor is the cooling technology needed … to keep the system operating.""

According to Air Force Times, Heithold initially proposed lasers as a countermeasure to enemy missiles, a defensive measure in place of the powerful 105mm cannon. But the idea eventually evolved into an offensive system capable of silently disabling enemy vehicles or infrastructure without firing a shot.

""The technology is ripe for doing this,"" Heithold told the Air Force Association`s conference in September. ""I`ve got the space, I`ve got the weight, and I`ve got the power.""

AFSOC hopes to see a combat operational AC-130J gunships by fiscal year 2018, with a fleet of 37 Ghostriders ready to bring the pain by 2020. But until then, AFSOC has a significant amount of testing to do: reducing vibrations to ensure a tight beam (!!!), integrating the weapons platform into an aircraft`s electrical systems, even just creating a ""window"" in the craft body from which a laser beam can actually shoot.

And beyond operational testing, funding challenges remain. Heithold, who left AFSOC in 2016, told National Defense that the Pentagon wants to invest $3.4 billion in directed-energy weapons across the entire DoD, and that the biggest roadblocks to a combat implementation might be the lack of a clear developmental roadmap (or, as usual, bickering).

But despite these potential obstacles, those who have seen the awesome power of the AC-130J Ghostrider are excited to see the gunship, bristling with firepower and futuristic weaponry, terrify enemies downrange sooner rather than later.

""Believe me,"" Webb told National Defense, ""this technology is quickly leaving the pages of science fiction.""

2627609,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take emergency steps to keep coal and nuclear power plants running, the White House said Friday, in what would amount to an unprecedented intervention in U.S. power markets.

FILE PHOTO: Power lines in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, lead away from the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant (C rear) in Vernon, Vermont August 27, 2013. REUTERS/Brian Snyder

The White House billed the effort as a way to shore up national energy security, but the announcement triggered swift backlash from an unusual alliance of drillers, renewable energy producers and environmentalists who called it an unfair attempt to prop up non-competitive industries.

“Unfortunately, impending retirements of fuel-secure power facilities are leading to a rapid depletion of a critical part of our nation’s energy mix, and impacting the resilience of our power grid,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement about the measure.

Since campaigning for the White House, Trump has vowed to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry. Both the U.S. coal and nuclear power industries have been shrinking for years, under pressure from cheaper natural gas along with advances in solar and wind energy.

As part of the plan, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) could exercise emergency authority under national security laws to direct the operators to buy electricity from coal and nuclear facilities, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters. (bit.ly/2LPCTp3)

Details of the memo, dated May 29 and circulated ahead of a National Security Council meeting on the subject on Friday, were first reported by Bloomberg News late on Thursday.

Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a major coal-mining state, on Friday praised Trump for carrying out what he said was his idea: “I am glad President Trump and his Administration are considering my idea to use the Defense Production Act to save coal-fired power plants with emissions controls and protect our national security,” Manchin said.

The Defense Production Act, adopted in 1950 at the start of the Korean War, allows the federal government to intervene in business to promote national security.

A coalition of oil, gas, solar, wind and energy efficiency trade groups, however, on Friday released joint statements on the move, calling the proposed action “misguided.”

“We strongly urge the administration to reject this ill-conceived draft plan and adopt a policy approach that promotes market forces and competition in our nation’s power system,” Todd Snitchler, director of market development at the American Petroleum Institute, said.

The administration has said it is concerned the retirement of old coal and nuclear plants could put U.S. power supplies at risk because - unlike solar, wind, and natural gas power facilities - coal and nuclear generators can store fuel on site.

But federal energy regulators have rejected that argument and turned down a proposal late last year from Perry to subsidize nuclear and coal plants for providing “resilience” to the grid.

That did not stop the coal industry from making new requests for help from the administration. In late March, FirstEnergy’s (FE.N) FirstEnergy Solutions [FE.UL] unit - which runs coal and nuclear power units - called on the U.S. energy secretary to use the emergency powers to lift the sectors.

Coal company CEO Robert Murray of Murray Energy [MUYEY.UL], also called for Perry to use emergency powers to save at-risk coal plants.

Analysts said the new plan would face numerous legal and political challenges before it could get implemented.

“While we believe DOE has broad privileges to identify threats to national security, we are skeptical that (the order) entitles DOE to direct power market operators (...) to pay generators more based upon that threat,” said Katie Bays, energy analyst at Height Capital Markets in Washington.

“Litigation would begin almost immediately,” she said.

Earlier this year, east coast grid operator PJM, which serves 65 million customers, published an analysis of recently announced planned deactivations of certain nuclear plants and determined that there was no immediate threat to system reliability. “There is no need for any such drastic action,” said a PJM spokesperson about the new idea."
3971101,"Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said Wednesday that the ""the carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

He said the US carrier fleet — the most powerful naval force — is adapting to meet threats from rivals, such as China, that are openly talking about sinking them.

The admiral emphasized that carriers are hard to kill, calling them the ""most survivable airfield.""

US aircraft carriers are a ""tremendous expression of US national power,"" and that makes them a target for adversarial powers, the US Navy`s top admiral said Wednesday.

""The big thing that is occupying our minds right now is the advent of long-range precision weapons, whether those are land-based ballistic missiles, coastal-defense cruise missiles, you name it,"" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said at the Atlantic Council, adding that the systems wielded by adversaries are ""becoming more capable.""

Chinese media has recently been hyping its ""carrier-killer"" DF-26 ballistic missiles, which are reportedly able to hit targets as far as 3,500 miles away. China released footage of the Chinese military test-firing the missile last month.

The purpose is to send ""a clear message to the US about China`s growing missile capability, and that it can hold at risk US strategic assets, such as carriers and bases,"" Adam Ni, who researches China at Macquarie University in Sydney, recently told the South China Morning Post.

""There`s two sides, an offensive part and a defensive part,"" Richardson said Wednesday, stressing that the Navy`s carriers are adapting to the new threats. ""The advent of some of new technologies, particularly directed energy technologies coupled with the emerging power generation capabilities on carriers, is going to make them a much, much more difficult target to hit.""

Speaking with the crew of the new supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford on Tuesday, Richardson said, ""You are going to be able to host a whole cadre of weapons that right now we can just start to dream about. We`re talking about electric weapons, high energy laser, high-powered microwave [and] very, very capable radars.""

The expensive $13 billion carrier is expected to be deployed in the next few years.

""Rather than expressing the carrier as uniquely vulnerable, I would say it is the most survivable airfield within the field of fire,"" Richardson said Wednesday in response to questions about carrier vulnerability. ""This is an airfield that can move 720 miles a day that has tremendous self-defense capabilities.""

""If you think about the sequence of events that has to emerge to be able to target and hit something that can move that much, and each step in that chain of events can be disrupted from the sensing part all the way back to the homing part, it’s the most survivable airfield in the area,"" he said.

Richardson said the carrier is less vulnerable now than at any time since World War II, when the US Navy was putting carriers in action, and those carriers were in combat taking hits. ""The carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

US carriers are particularly hard, albeit not impossible, to kill.

Talbot Manvel, who served as an aircraft-carrier engineer and was involved in the design of the new Ford-class carriers, told Business Insider previously.

The new aircraft, nicknamed the Tempest, is a joint venture with British aerospace companies BAE Systems Plc, Rolls Royce Holdings Plc, MBDA UK Ltd and Anglo-Italian firm Leonardo SpA.

“We are entering a dangerous new era in warfare,” Williamson said, pulling a curtain off the silver and white fighter jet. The U.K. aims to “keep control of the air both at home and abroad.” He called for more details of the business case to be set out by the end of this year, with the ultimate goal for the aircraft to be operational in 2035.

The UK Secretary of State for Defence, Gavin Williamson also announced USD2.65 billion of government funding to oversee the design and build of the aircraft through 2025, when a final decision would be taken on the program’s future.

At the Farnborough International Air Show a next-generation fighter concept model was revealed showcasing key technologies that will be important in the future. The concept gives an indication of the types of technologies that we and our partners are developing and investing in so that we can deliver world leading capabilities for the future.

A future combat air system must be able to survive the most challenging combat environments meaning that payload-range, speed and manoeuvrability will be key. We expect that the system will be equipped with a range of sensors including radio frequency, active and passive electro-optical sensors and advanced electronic support measures to detect and intercept threats.

The system is likely to operate with kinetic and non-kinetic weapons. The integration of Laser Directed Energy Weapons for self-defence and use within visual range combat is also highly likely. The ability to deploy and manage air launched ‘swarming’ Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) through a flexible payload bay allows the system to address dangerous Anti-Access Area Denial environments.

Air forces of the future will require a fighter system that is highly flexible and can be applied to a wide variety of military operations. Operators will have the ability to rapidly adapt the system to perform new functions or to change its performance.

Depending on the mission, ‘role fit’ additions such as low observable conformal fuel tanks, weapons dispensers, air launched UAV dispensers, large modular sensors, long range oblique photography systems for reconnaissance and Laser Directed Energy Weapons could be available.

Adaptability will be built into the system design, with systems architectures which support a ‘plug and play’ approach, easily integrating new algorithms and hardware. The system will also support ‘scalable autonomy’ to provide a number of modes of unmanned operation and a range pilot decisions aids when manned flight is being conducted. These features are dynamically reconfigurable and serve to enhance survivability, availability, cyber resilience, and tactical options.

To deliver significant information advantage and mission effectiveness, the future combat air system will act as a ‘force multiplier’, interoperating with a wide range of other civil and military platforms and services across air, land, sea, space and cyber domains – as well as unmanned systems. Command and control of other systems, such as UAVs, will be enabled from a fully customisable virtual cockpit, with advanced human machine interfaces including eye tracking and gesture based controls, offering intuitive and sophisticated mission management. Using a similar virtual approach, both mission planning on the ground, and the remote command of unmanned aircraft can be enhanced, ensuring a rapid and effective understanding of the battlespace. The FCAS will be quickly and affordably upgradable, maintaining Operational Advantage and Freedom of Action in a rapidly evolving threat environment. Physical interfaces must therefore be strong, lightweight, numerous, and affordably produced. This will be achieved through our expertise in additive layer manufacture, joining and fastener technology, ‘geometric locking’, and low observable materials. Robotic and cobotic assembly is likely to play a significant role.

The U.K.also is in discussions with other countries about partnering on the project that would also maintain some 18,000 jobs at home. Suggestions include a pact with Sweden, where Saab AB makes the Gripen fighter, or possibly Japan and elsewhere in Asia, where demand for warplanes is increasing as China and India flex their military muscle, the person said. The fighter jet is under development by “Team Tempest,” a joint operation between the aerospace companies and the Royal Air Force’s Rapid Capability Office under the Future Combat Air Strategy Technology Initiative. It could end up competing with a model being developed by France and Germany, potentially ending decades of cross-channel cooperation on warplane production, according to a person familiar with the program."
3544728,"Conspiracy theorists have posited some outlandish theories about the origin of the Paradise and Woolsey wildfires in California.

We asked a wildfire expert and former FEMA official about the real source of the flames.

In addition to natural forces and human activity, climate change is contributing to more frequent and severe wildfires, according to a dire new report by the Trump administration.

The Woolsey and Paradise wildfires brought widespread devastation to California in November, killing more than 90 people and torching 250,000 acres of land.

With the fires now fully contained, residents have returned home to find nothing but scorched foundations. Officials are still on the hunt for hundreds of missing people — a process made more difficult by the onslaught of rain.

In the aftermath of the blazes, many are demanding to know how they got started.

Determining the cause of a wildfire can take months of investigation , which includes scouring the charred soil for clues.

In the meantime, conspiracy theorists have taken to YouTube to posit their own explanations.

Crazy wildfire theories

The most widely circulated theory seems to have originated with the far-right conspiracy group QAnon, which often propagates wild assertions about Hollywood actors and high-ranking officials.

The group is now claiming that the California wildfires were caused by lasers or directed energy weapons manipulated by the US government. Some conspiracists argue that the fires were a government-led attempt to destroy entire regions, while others have suggested that the US was trying to clear a path for a high-speed rail system .

Read more: California`s devastating wildfires are part of an alarming trend — here`s why they`ve gotten so much worse

Last year`s wildfires yielded similarly bogus claims, which spread across YouTube and other platforms.

To set the record straight, we talked to Marko Bourne, a former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) official who now leads Booz Allen Hamilton`s emergency management, disaster assistance, and risk practice.

Like most scientists, Bourne attributed the wildfires to a combination of weather and human activity.

By building on land that is susceptible to wildfires — namely, forested areas — humans have essentially put themselves in harm`s way.

""While forest fires have always happened, [people] have impinged into areas that are prone to fire,"" he said. ""Now we` re being impacted by those fires directly, where we wouldn`t have [been before].""

Of the few natural causes of wildfires, lighting strikes are the most common.There`s also the possibility that fires can be started bypower lines.Bourne said that`s an atypical scenario, though it may have been the cause of last year`s Camp Fire in California wine country.

The vast majority of wildfires in the US are caused by human activities such as neglecting campfires, flinging cigarette butts, burning debris, or committing arson.

But not every one of these errors can ignite a flame. Dry, windy conditions and low humidity tends to encourage the spread of wildfires and make them harder to control.

Fires also require some sort of ammunition.

“Wildfires have occurred, and continue to occur, in areas where there`s fuel,” said Bourne. That fuel may be dry leaves, trees, underbrush — or, in some cases, homes.

How to explain the flames

One of the main questions among YouTube conspiracists is why the California fires destroyed certain homes and not others.

""You`ll notice here that stores and restaurants are wiped out, while other things are still in perfect shape,"" one YouTuber, who goes by the name ODD Reality, said in a video clip . ""Other buildings are fine, trees are untouched, but specific structures are just devastated. You gotta ask yourself, what`s up with that?""

Wildfire experts have a pretty clear answer .

""Once a wildfire gets going, they create almost their own weather patterns,"" said Bourne.

When a fire ignites, its embers can be dispersed by the wind. If they blow toward a house with broken or open windows, flammable landscape materials, or gutters littered with debris, they can begin to smolder and start a flame.

""Most everything we use in home construction can burn,"" said Bourne. ""Some materials like steel and concrete and brick don`t burn per se, but our homes will always have flammable materials.""

Bourne noted that materials used in today`s construction, such as plastics and laminates, can become exceptionally hot, while older construction doesn`t burn as readily.

But there`s another factor to consider — one that the conspiracists have already attempted to shoot down .

A recent climate change report published by the Trump administration finds that extreme temperatures caused by human activity could increase the length and magnitude of wildfire season in the Pacific Northwest.

The report also citesa 2016 study, which found that climate change nearly doubled the area of western forests that were burned between 1984 and 2015.

To top it off, extreme temperatures are expected to increase fire frequency in the southeast.

While weather conditions certainly contribute to wildfires, greenhouse gases are making this weather more extreme. That means we can expect more blazes in the future — and more conspiracy theories to go along with them."
1545258,"San Diego hosts a rare gathering of the nation’s top military leaders.

The Chief of Naval Operations joined the commandants of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard in talking about the future of warfare.

Possible threats to America’s military superiority include rising Russia and China.

A generation of sailors and Marines who waged counterinsurgency wars overseas must adapt quickly to a changed world, where rising powers such as Russia and China threaten to usurp America’s once impervious military.

That was the urgent message delivered Thursday afternoon at San Diego’s convention center during a rare public gathering of three service leaders: Chief of Naval Operations John M. Richardson, Marine Corps commandant Gen. Robert Neller and Coast Guard commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft.

In an hourlong discussion moderated by retired Navy Adm. James G. Stavridis before a packed audience, they described the vital need for a steady funding stream to retrain and rearm services straining from nearly 17 years of constant counter-terror operations.

Hoping to avert another government shutdown, lawmakers on Capitol Hill struggled Thursday to pass a stop-gap spending measure along with a long-term budget that sends $165 billion to the Pentagon over the next two years and increased the federal debt more than $1 trillion.

Over the past decade, Congress paid the military’s bills with a series of continuing resolutions, with fewer funds for the services due to spending caps enacted in 2011’s so-called “sequestration” legislation.

“I’m hopeful that it’ll pass and it’s a lot of money,” Neller said. “But we’re going to get that money like we did last year, with about half the fiscal year left to spend it. That’s not any way to run a business.”

Although both he and Zukunft fretted about the national debt and its economic effects in coming years, Neller said that the influx of military spending was important to preserve the nation’s survival.

“The adversary out there is making big bets, big investments, in their capacity. And their capabilities have grown,” Neller said. “Whether they want to take us on or not, we have to be able to go and display the capability to deter them.”

Richardson said his top priority was revamping the Navy’s ballistic submarine fleet. The underwater Navy carries 70 percent of America’s nuclear warheads.

“Without that strategic deterrent, we’re really in a different world,” said Richardson, a career submariner and the former director of the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program. “Everything becomes impossibly harder. That’s got to succeed.”

Neller said the Navy needs more attack subs, too. The fleet is supposed to deploy 66 of them but today there are only 50 left, a number expected to fall to 43 before shipyards begin churning out two Virginia-class replacements annually in the next decade.

The silent hunters of the deep sail ahead of carrier and amphibious strike groups, sniffing out enemy subs and spying on a foe’s battle fleets.

“We need more attack submarines, OK? I need to get where I’m going,” Neller said.

“When was the last time we had to fight to get to the fight? We just went. We didn’t have to fight to get there,” he continued, pointing to the guerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“We’re going to have to fight to get to the fight.”

Once in the thick of battle, Neller will need newer aircraft, swapping out his aging fleet with fifth-generation jets, tilt-rotor vehicles and high-tech helicopters.

He also wants more reliable and resilient command and control systems. That’s the technology that helps Marines know where their units are in relation to the enemy, clearing the fog of war. The challenge is keeping those networks up while the foe tries to jam, degrade or destroy them.

“We’re trying to create a modern Marine Corps,” Neller said. “The stuff we have we take good care of, but there are Marines over here wrenching on vehicles older than they are.”

Watching an increasingly wealthy Beijing build increasingly sophisticated warships, aircraft and missiles, Richardson said the Pentagon needs to reform the procurement process so that the Navy can more quickly and cheaply deploy vessels.

To contain costs, those ships need smaller crews but can make up the difference with better automated systems, sensors and weapons packing a more powerful punch from longer distances, he added.

They’ll be helped by underwater and aerial drones, plus new directed energy weapons like lasers, he said, but Congress also has mandated a 355-ship Navy.Today he can deploy 280. The problem is America’s industrial base. Shipbuilding capacity today is a third of what the Navy could get in 1955.

“There are 14 shipyards that build ships that shuttered or got out of the defense business,” Richardson said. “So you can see these two conflicting trends — the need to grow the number of ships and yet we just don’t have the industrial capacity to do it.”

Although Zukunft is finally getting the first large icebreaker built for the Coast Guard in four decades, his aging fleet of patrol boats on inland waterways struggles to keep $4.6 trillion in American commerce flowing.

Modern replacements will cost more than $15 million each but the commandant needs them to cost less to maintain and fuel, saving money in the long run.

“Some are 73 years old now,” he said. “It’s not a huge ask but it’s a huge return on investment.”

3057933,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia is the main suspect in U.S. agencies’ investigation of mysterious illnesses in American personnel in Cuba and China, NBC News reported on Tuesday.

Evidence from communications intercepts has pointed to Moscow’s involvement during the investigation involving the FBI, CIA and other agencies, NBC reported, citing three unidentified U.S. officials and two other people briefed on the probe.

The evidence, however, is not conclusive enough for the United States to assign blame publicly to Moscow, according to the NBC report.

FBI and CIA officials did not immediately return a request for comment on the report.

U.S. officials said in July that they are still investigating health problems at the U.S. embassy in Cuba, and do not know who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses, which began in 2016 and have affected 26 Americans.

FILE PHOTO: Cuban employees enter the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, August 22, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer

Symptoms have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said.

The State Department said in June it brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady resembling brain injury.

Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied any involvement or knowledge of what was behind it.

The United States believes sophisticated electromagnetic weapons may have been used on government workers, possibly in conjunction with other technologies, NBC reported.

The U.S. military has been trying to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, including by testing various devices on animals, NBC said, citing Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others.

Part of the work is being done at the directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves, NBC said."
1109473,"The appearance of the new J-20 (unofficially dubbed “Black Eagle”) raised many questions about the Chinese stealth fighter. Some experts think it will be more capable than the F-22; others (and I’m among these ones) think that the real problem for the US with the J-20 is not with the aircraft’s performance, equipment and capabilities (even if the US legacy fighters were designed 20 years earlier than current Chinese or Russian fighters of the same “class”); the problem is that China will probably build thousands of them.

Anyway, comparing the US and Chinese fighters, everybody referred to “fifth generation planes” bringing once again the concept of “fighter generation” under the spotlight.

Generations are a common way to classify jet fighters. Often, generations have been “assigned” to fighters in accordance with the timeframes encompassing the peak period of service entry for such aircraft.

The best definition I’ve found so far of fighter generations is the one contained in an article published in 2009 by Air Force Magazine, that proposes a generations breakdown based on capabilities:

Generation 1: Jet propulsion

Generation 2: Swept wings; range-only radar; infrared missiles

Generation 3: Supersonic speed; pulse radar; able to shoot at targets beyond visual range.

Generation 4: Pulse-doppler radar; high maneuverability; look-down, shoot-down missiles.

Generation 4+: High agility; sensor fusion; reduced signatures.

Generation 4++: Active electronically scanned arrays; continued reduced signatures or some “active” (waveform canceling) stealth; some supercruise.

Generation 5: All-aspect stealth with internal weapons, extreme agility, full-sensor fusion, integrated avionics, some or full supercruise.

Potential Generation 6: extreme stealth; efficient in all flight regimes (subsonic to multi-Mach); possible “morphing” capability; smart skins; highly networked; extremely sensitive sensors; optionally manned; directed energy weapons.

In order to give the readers a rough idea of the type of aircraft belonging to each generation based on the above breakdown I’ve prepared the following table with the help of Tom Cooper / ACIG.org and Ugo Crisponi / Aviatiographic.com, who provided the profiles. It’s not meant to show all the aircraft theoretically belonging to a generation and includes only the profiles available at the time of writing…

As I’ve already said on Twitter, what such a table should let you understand at a glance is that capabilities and appearance are inversely proportional: former generations aircraft look much better than more modern fighters…..

2943460,"The administration of US President Donald Trump has proposed new rules that would scale back limits on coal-fired power plants, a move critics said would have dire environmental and health consequences.

The proposal, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday, would broadly increase the leeway given to states to decide how much to regulate coal power plants.

The EPA said it ""empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.""

Tuesday`s proposal is the latest move by the current administration to roll back environmental protections put in place by Trump`s predecessor, President Barack Obama.

Combined with the EPA`s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move could increase the country`s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump`s ""Dirty Power Plan"".

{articleGUID}

Democratic Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer`s wildfires, increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already happening.

""Once again, this administration is choosing polluters` profits over public health and safety,"" he said.

Scientists said that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Senator John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration`s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

`Reviving the coal industry`

Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia, a top coal-producing state, on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country`s power producers towards less-polluting energy from natural gas, wind and solar power, among others.

Meanwhile, Trump also directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut US carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

The Supreme Court put Obama`s plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

The Trump administration is emphasizing ""coal at all costs,"" said Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed.

""They are continuing to play to their base and following industry`s lead,"" she said.

The EPA`s proposal is open for a public comment period, with a final ruling expected later this year.

2256210,"The Trump administration has proposed a major rollback in Obama-era restrictions on climate-changing emissions from coal-fired power plants. The plan announced Tuesday gives the states more discretion in choosing how to regulate pollution from the plants. The Environmental Protection Agency says the move ""promotes energy independence."" Environmental groups say it will harm the fight against global warming.

The move targets a major climate change effort of the Obama administration, which sought to reduce release of climate-changing emissions and other pollutants from the coal-fired power plants.

An EPA statement calls the Obama plan ""burdensome.""

The plan also would let states relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades, according to a summary of the plan and several people familiar with the full proposal who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren`t authorized to discuss the plan publicly.

Combined with a planned rollback of car-mileage standards, the plan represents a significant retreat from Obama-era efforts to fight climate change and would reverse an Obama-era push to shift away from coal and toward less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power. Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

A three-page summary being circulated at the White House focuses on boosting efficiency at coal-fired power plants and allowing states to reduce ""wasteful compliance costs"" while focusing on improved environmental outcomes. Critics say focusing on improved efficiency would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

The White House rejects that criticism.

""Carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector will continue to fall under this rule, but this will happen legally and with proper respect for the states, unlike"" the Clean Power Plan, the summary says. The AP obtained a copy of the summary, which asserts that the Obama-era plan exceeds the EPA`s authority under the Clean Air Act.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a ""war on coal"" waged by Obama.

""This is really a plan to prop up coal plants — or try to,"" said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The Trump plan ""will make no meaningful reductions"" in greenhouse gas emissions ""and it probably will make emissions worse,"" Doniger said.

Gina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator when the Clean Power Plan was created in 2015, said that based on draft proposals and news reports, she expects the plan will not set specific federal targets for reducing emissions from coal-fired plants. The plan is expected to address power plants individually rather than across the electric grid as the EPA proposed under Obama. The new plan would give utilities and states more flexibility in achieving emissions reductions, but critics say it could harm public health.

""They are continuing to play to their base and following industry`s lead,"" McCarthy said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. ""This is all about coal at all costs.""

Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the ""gross overreach"" of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements.

""We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,"" she said."
3984458,"Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said Wednesday that the ""the carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

He said the US carrier fleet - the most powerful naval force - is adapting to meet threats from rivals, such as China, that are openly talking about sinking them.

The admiral emphasized that carriers are hard to kill, calling them the ""most survivable airfield.""

US aircraft carriers are a ""tremendous expression of US national power,"" and that makes them a target for adversarial powers, the US Navy`s top admiral said Wednesday.

""The big thing that is occupying our minds right now is the advent of long-range precision weapons, whether those are land-based ballistic missiles, coastal-defense cruise missiles, you name it,"" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said at the Atlantic Council, adding that the systems wielded by adversaries are ""becoming more capable.""

Chinese media has recently been hyping its ""carrier-killer"" DF-26 ballistic missiles, which are reportedly able to hit targets as far as 3,500 miles away. China released footage of the Chinese military test-firing the missile last month.

The purpose is to send ""a clear message to the US about China`s growing missile capability, and that it can hold at risk US strategic assets, such as carriers and bases,"" Adam Ni, who researches China at Macquarie University in Sydney, recently told the South China Morning Post.

""There`s two sides, an offensive part and a defensive part,"" Richardson said Wednesday, stressing that the Navy`s carriers are adapting to the new threats. ""The advent of some of new technologies, particularly directed energy technologies coupled with the emerging power generation capabilities on carriers, is going to make them a much, much more difficult target to hit.""

Speaking with the crew of the new supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford on Tuesday, Richardson said, ""You are going to be able to host a whole cadre of weapons that right now we can just start to dream about. We`re talking about electric weapons, high energy laser, high-powered microwave [and] very, very capable radars.""

The expensive $13 billion carrier is expected to be deployed in the next few years.

""Rather than expressing the carrier as uniquely vulnerable, I would say it is the most survivable airfield within the field of fire,"" Richardson said Wednesday in response to questions about carrier vulnerability. ""This is an airfield that can move 720 miles a day that has tremendous self-defense capabilities.""

""If you think about the sequence of events that has to emerge to be able to target and hit something that can move that much, and each step in that chain of events can be disrupted from the sensing part all the way back to the homing part, it`s the most survivable airfield in the area,"" he said.

Richardson said the carrier is less vulnerable now than at any time since World War II, when the US Navy was putting carriers in action, and those carriers were in combat taking hits. ""The carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

US carriers are particularly hard, albeit not impossible, to kill.

4377612,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just when it looks like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may restart his ballistic missile testing program, U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed trimming the missile defense budget, as one set of deterrents is delayed by two years.

The U.S. Missile Defense Agency - charged with developing, testing and fielding a ballistic missile defense system - will delay the expansion of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system by two years because of a delay in the redesign of the Raytheon Co-made “kill vehicle” the system uses.

A “kill vehicle” pops off the top of the defending missile above the Earth’s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile’s warhead.

The GMD is a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles based in Alaska and California, and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS.

The expansion of the field of interceptors in Alaska from 44 ground-based interceptors, or GBIs, to 64 had been slated for completion in 2023. But the delay, due to technical issues and not connected to the cut in the agency’s budget, now means that the placement of the additional 20 interceptors will not be operational until 2025, the MDA said on Tuesday.

“The important thing is to get it right, and if we’re going to build more GBI’s, we want to put the best kill vehicle on the top of it,” said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

At the same time, North Korea has been pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program after a summit meeting between Kim and Trump in Hanoi ended abruptly on Feb. 28 without an agreement on denuclearization.

New activity has been detected at a North Korean ICBM plant, South Korean media said on Thursday, as Trump said he would be “very disappointed” if Pyongyang rebuilt a rocket site.

In the budget, the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, saw its appropriation cut by $1 billion to $9.4 billion.

Michelle Atkinson, chief financial officer of the MDA, told reporters, “What you are seeing in ‘20 actually looks like a decrease, but it’s really just the declining funding,” as the agency comes off recent financial injections.

Trump’s smaller request comes on the heels of a significant budget boost last year after several North Korean missile tests.

The MDA projected a budget of $9.2 billion in 2021, and $9.1 billion in 2022, continuing the trend of declining funding.

One Pentagon-wide effort in lasers that could be used to defeat missiles saw investment slow dramatically. After nearly doubling just the MDA’s budget for directed energy from $109 million in 2018 to $224 million in 2019, the Pentagon as a whole plans to invest only $235 million in the technology in fiscal 2020.

Among other proposals included in a recently published Missile Defense Review is one involving lasers mounted on drones - aimed at stopping missiles just after takeoff in what is called the boost phase.

During this portion of the flight the missile is most vulnerable, flying at its slowest speed, easily detected by the heat from its engines and incapable of evading interceptors as it accelerates to break out of the Earth’s atmosphere."

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday came out with new rules scaling back Obama-era constraints on coal-fired power plants, striking at one of the former administration’s legacy programs to rein in climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency called the Obama-era regulations on coal power plants “overly prescriptive and burdensome.”

The Trump administration plan broadly increases the leeway given states to decide how and how much to regulate coal power plants. The EPA says it “empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.”

Combined with the EPA’s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move may actually increase the country’s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump’s “Dirty Power Plan.”

Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer’s wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. “Once again, this administration is choosing polluters’ profits over public health and safety,” he said.

Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration’s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

The new proposal establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing any plans to limit climate-changing emissions from power plants. Critics say the new plan would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often and extend the plants’ overall operating life, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry. The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country’s power producers to natural gas, wind and solar power, and other less-polluting power sources.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama.

“They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed, said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.”

Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements.

“We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said.

Tuesday’s move opens a public-comment period on the proposal before any final administration action.

China, Russia, and the US are are starting to invest heavily in producing hypersonic weapons — projectiles that zoom to their targets at Mach 5 and evade air defenses.

Hypersonic weapons are just the most recent manifestation of the misguided urge to engage in an ""arms race,"" writes Rajan Menon, a professor of international relations at the City College of New York.

Visit Business Insider`s homepage for more stories.

Hypersonic weapons close in on their targets at a minimum speed of Mach 5, five times the speed of sound or 3,836.4 miles an hour. They are among the latest entrants in an arms competition that has embroiled the United States for generations, first with the Soviet Union, today with China and Russia.

Pentagon officials tout the potential of such weaponry and the largest arms manufacturers are totally gung-ho on the subject. No surprise there. They stand to make staggering sums from building them, especially given the chronic ""cost overruns"" of such defense contracts — $163 billion in the far-from-rare case of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.

Voices within the military-industrial complex — the Defense Department; mega-defense companies like Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Boeing, and Raytheon; hawkish armchair strategists in Washington-based think tanks and universities; and legislators from places that depend on arms production for jobs — insist that these are must-have weapons. Their refrain: unless we build and deploy them soon we could suffer a devastating attack from Russia and China.

The opposition to this powerful ensemble`s doomsday logic is, as always, feeble.

The (il)logic of arms races

Hypersonic weapons are just the most recent manifestation of the urge to engage in an ""arms race,"" even if, as a sports metaphor, it couldn`t be more off base.

Take, for instance, a bike or foot race. Each has a beginning, a stipulated distance, and an end, as well as a goal: Crossing the finish line ahead of your rivals. In theory, an arms race should at least have a starting point, but in practice, it`s usually remarkably hard to pin down, making for interminable disputes about who really started us down this path. Historians, for instance, are still writing (and arguing) about the roots of the arms race that culminated in World War I.

The arms version of a sports race lacks a purpose (apart from the perpetuation of a competition fueled by an endless action-reaction sequence). The participants just keep at it, possessed by worst-case thinking, suspicion, and fear, sentiments sustained by bureaucracies whose budgets and political clout often depend on military spending, companies that rake in the big bucks selling the weaponry, and a priesthood of professional threat inflators who merchandise themselves as ""security experts.""

While finish lines (other than the finishing of most life on this planet) are seldom in sight, arms-control treaties can, at least, decelerate and muffle the intensity of arms races. But at least so far, they`ve never ended them and they themselves survive only as long as the signatories want them to.

Recall President George W. Bush`s scuttling of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Trump administration`s exit from the Cold War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in August. Similarly, the New START accord, which covered long-range nuclear weapons and was signed by Russia and the United States in 2010, will be up for renewal in 2021 and its future, should Donald Trump be reelected, is uncertain at best.

Apart from the fragility built into such treaties, new vistas for arms competition inevitably emerge — or, more precisely, are created. Hypersonic weapons are just the latest example.

Arms races, though waged in the name of national security, invariably create yet more insecurity. Imagine two adversaries neither of whom knows what new weapon the other will field. So both just keep building new ones. That gets expensive. And such spending only increases the number of threats.

Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, US military spending has consistently and substantially exceeded China`s and Russia`s combined. But can you name a government that imagines more threats on more fronts than ours? This endless enumeration of new vulnerabilities isn`t a form of paranoia. It`s meant to keep arms races humming and the money flowing into military (and military-industrial) coffers.

One-dimensional national security

Such arms races come from the narrow, militarized definition of ""national security"" that prevails inside the defense and intelligence establishment, as well as in think tanks, universities, and the most influential mass media. Their underlying assumptions are rarely challenged, which only adds to their power. We`re told that we must produce a particular weapon (price tag be damned!), because if we don`t, the enemy will and that will imperil us all.

Such a view of security is by now so deeply entrenched in Washington — shared by Republicans and Democrats alike — that alternatives are invariably derided as naïve or quixotic. As it happens, both of those adjectives would be more appropriate descriptors for the predominant national security paradigm, detached as it is from what really makes most Americans feel insecure.

Consider a few examples.

Unlike in the first three decades after World War II, since 1979 the average US hourly wage, adjusted for inflation, has increased by a pitiful amount, despite substantial increases in worker productivity. Unsurprisingly, those on the higher rungs of the wage ladder (to say nothing of those at the top) have made most of the gains, creating a sharp increase in wage inequality. (If you consider net total household wealth rather than income alone, the share of the top 1% increased from 30% to 39% between 1989 and 2016, while that of the bottom 90% dropped from 33% to 23%.)

Because of sluggish wage growth many workers find it hard to land jobs that pay enough to cover basic life expenses even when, as now, unemployment is low (3.6% this year compared to 8% in 2013). Meanwhile, millions earning low wages, particularly single mothers who want to work, struggle to find affordable childcare — not surprising considering that in 10 states and the District of Columbia the annual cost of such care exceeded $10,000 last year; and that, in 28 states, childcare centers charged more than the cost of tuition and fees at four-year public colleges.

Workers trapped in low-wage jobs are also hard-pressed to cover unanticipated expenses. In 2018, the ""median household"" banked only $11,700, and households with incomes in the bottom 20% had, on average, only $8,790 in savings; 29% of them, $1,000 or less. (For the wealthiest 1% of households, the median figure was $2.5 million.) Forty-four percent of American families would be unable to cover emergency-related expenses in excess of $400 without borrowing money or selling some of their belongings.

That, in turn, means many Americans can`t adequately cover periods of extended unemployment or illness, even when unemployment benefits are added in.

Then there`s the burden of medical bills. The percentage of uninsured adults has risen from 10.9% to 13.7% since 2016 and often your medical insurance is tied to your job — lose it and you lose your coverage — not to speak of the high deductibles imposed by many medical insurance policies. (Out-of-pocket medical expenses have, in fact, increased fourfold since 2007 and now average $1,300 a year.)

Or, speaking of insecurity, consider the epidemic in opioid-related fatalities (400,000 people since 1999), or suicides (47,173 in 2017 alone), or murders involving firearms (14,542 in that same year). Child poverty? The US rate was higher than that of 32 of the 36 other economically developed countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Now ask yourself this: how often do you hear our politicians or pundits use a definition of ""national security"" that includes any of these daily forms of American insecurity? Admittedly, progressive politicians do speak about the economic pressures millions of Americans face, but never as part of a discussion of national security.

Politicians who portray themselves as ""budget hawks"" flaunt the label, but their outrage over ""irresponsible"" or ""wasteful"" spending seldom extends to a national security budget that currently exceeds $1 trillion.

Hawks claim that the country must spend as much as it does because it has a worldwide military presence and a plethora of defense commitments. That presumes, however, that both are essential for American security when sensible and less extravagant alternatives are on offer.

In that context, let`s return to the ""race"" for hypersonic weapons.

Faster than a speeding bullet

Although the foundation for today`s hypersonic weaponry was laid decades ago, the pace of progress has been slow because of daunting technical challenges. Developing materials like composite ceramics capable of withstanding the intense heat to which such weapons will be exposed during flight leads the list.

In recent years, though, countries have stepped up their games hoping to deploy hypersonic armaments rapidly, something Russia has already begun to do.

China, Russia, and the United States lead the hypersonic arms race, but others — including Britain, France, Germany, India, and Japan — have joined in (and more undoubtedly will do so). Each has its own list of dire scenarios against which hypersonic weapons will supposedly protect them and military missions for which they see such armaments as ideal. In other words, a new round in an arms race aimed at Armageddon is already well underway.

There are two variants of hypersonic weapons, which can both be equipped with conventional or nuclear warheads and can also demolish their targets through sheer speed and force of impact, or kinetic energy.

""Boost-glide vehicles"" (HGVs) are lofted skyward on ballistic missiles or aircraft. Separated from their transporter, they then hurtle through the atmosphere, pulled toward their target by gravity, while picking up momentum along the way. Unlike ballistic missiles, which generally fly most of the way in a parabolic trajectory — think of an inverted U — ranging in altitude from nearly 400 to nearly 750 miles high, HGVs stay low, maxing out about 62 miles up.

The combination of their hypersonic speed and lower altitude shortens the journey, while theoretically flummoxing radars and defenses designed to track and intercept ballistic missile warheads (which means another kind of arms race still to come).

A screenshot from a video about hypersonic missile nonproliferation made by the RAND Corporation that shows the two types of hypersonic weapons under development TheRANDCorporation/YouTube

By contrast, hypersonic cruise missiles (HCMs) resemble pilotless aircraft, propelled from start to finish by an on-board engine. They are, however, lighter than standard cruise missiles because they use ""scramjet"" technology.

Rather than carrying liquid oxygen tanks, the missile ""breathes"" in outside air that passes through it at supersonic speed, its oxygen combining with the missile`s hydrogen fuel. The resulting combustion generates extreme heat, propelling the missile toward its target. HCMs fly even lower than HGVs, below 100,000 feet, which makes identifying and destroying them harder yet.

Weapons are categorized as hypersonic when they can reach a speed of at least Mach 5, but versions that travel much faster are in the works.

A Chinese HGV, launched by the Dong Feng (East Wind) DF-ZF ballistic missile, reportedly registered a speed of up to Mach 10 during tests, which began in 2014. Russia`s Kh-47M2 Kinzhal, or ""Dagger,"" launched from a bomber or interceptor, can reportedly also reach a speed of Mach 10. Lockheed Martin`s AGM-183A Advanced Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), an HGV that was first test-launched from a B-52 bomber this year, can apparently reach the staggering speed of Mach 20.

And yet it`s not just the speed and flight trajectory of hypersonic weapons that will make them so hard to track and intercept. They can also maneuver as they race toward their targets. Unsurprisingly, efforts to develop defenses against them, using low-orbit sensors, microwave technology, and ""directed energy"" have already begun.

The Trump administration`s plans for a new Space Force that will put sensors and interceptors into space cite the threat of hypersonic missiles. Even so, critics have slammed the initiative for being poorly funded.

Putting aside the technical complexities of building defenses against hypersonic weapons, the American decision to withdraw from the ABM Treaty and develop missile-defense systems influenced Russia`s decision to develop hypersonic weapons capable of penetrating such defenses. These are meant to ensure that Russia`s nuclear forces will continue to serve as a credible deterrent against a nuclear first strike on that country.

The trio takes the lead

China, Russia, and the United States are, of course, leading the hypersonic race to hell. China tested a medium-range new missile, the DF-17 in late 2017, and used an HGV specifically designed to be launched by it. The following year, that country tested its rocket-launched Xing Kong-2 (Starry Sky-2), a ""wave rider,"" which gains momentum by surfing the shockwaves it produces.

In addition to its Kinzhal, Russia successfully tested the Avangard HGV in 2018. The SS-19 ballistic missile that launched it will eventually be replaced by the R-28 Samrat. Its hypersonic cruise missile, the Tsirkon, designed to be launched from a ship or submarine, has also been tested several times since 2015. Russia`s hypersonic program has had its failures — so has ours — but there`s no doubting Moscow`s seriousness about pursuing such weaponry.

Though it`s common to read that both Russia and China are significantly ahead in this arms race, the United States has been no laggard. It`s been interested in such weaponry — specifically HGVs — since the early years of this century. The Air Force awarded Boeing and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne a contract to develop the hypersonic X-51A WaveRider scramjet in 2004. Its first flight test — which failed (creating something of a pattern) — took place in 2010.

Today, the Army, Navy, and Air Force are moving ahead with major hypersonic weapons programs.

For instance, the Air Force test-launched its ARRW from a B-52 bomber as part of its Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) this June; the Navy tested an HGV in 2017 to further its Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) initiative; and the Army tested its own version of such a weapon in 2011 and 2014 to move its Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW) program forward.

The depth of the Pentagon`s commitment to hypersonic weapons became evident in 2018 when it decided to combine the Navy`s CPS, the Air Force`s HCSW, and the Army`s AHW to advance the Conventional Prompt Global Strike Program (CPGS), which seeks to build the capability to hit targets worldwide in under 60 minutes.

That`s not all. The Center for Public Integrity`s R. Jeffrey Smith reports that Congress passed a bill last year requiring the United States to have operational hypersonic weapons by late 2022. President`s Trump`s 2020 Pentagon budget request included $2.6 billion to support their development. Smith expects the annual investment to reach $5 billion by the mid-2020s.

That will certainly happen if officials like Michael Griffin, the Pentagon`s undersecretary for research and engineering, have their way.

Speaking at the McAleese and Credit Suisse Defense Programs conference in March 2018, he listed hypersonic weapons as his ""highest technical priority,"" adding, ""I`m sorry for everybody out there who champions some other high priority... But there has to be a first and hypersonics is my first.""

The big defense contractors share his enthusiasm. No wonder last December the National Defense Industrial Association, an outfit that lobbies for defense contractors, played host to Griffin and Patrick Shanahan (then the deputy secretary of defense), for the initial meeting of what it called the ""Hypersonic Community of Influence.""

Cassandra or Pollyanna?

We are, in other words, in a familiar place. Advances in technology have prepared the ground for a new phase of the arms race. Driving it, once again, is fear among the leading powers that their rivals will gain an advantage, this time in hypersonic weapons.

What then? In a crisis, a state that gained such an advantage might, they warn, attack an adversary`s nuclear forces, military bases, airfields, warships, missile defenses, and command-and-control networks from great distances with stunning speed.

Such nightmarish scenario-building could simply be dismissed as wild-eyed speculation, but the more states think about, plan, and build weaponry along these lines, the greater the danger that a crisis could spiral into a hypersonic war once such weaponry was widely deployed.

Imagine a crisis in the South China Sea in which the United States and China both have functional hypersonic weapons: China sees them as a means of blocking advancing American forces; the United States, as a means to destroy the very hypersonic arms China could use to achieve that objective. Both know this, so the decision of one or the other to fire first could come all too easily.

Or, now that the INF Treaty has died, imagine a crisis in Europe involving the United States and Russia after both sides have deployed numerous intermediate-range hypersonic cruise missiles on the continent.

Some wonks say, in effect, Relax, hi-tech defenses against hypersonic weapons will be built, so crises like these won`t spin out of control. They seem to forget that defensive military innovations inevitably lead to offensive ones designed to negate them. Hypersonic weapons won`t prove to be the exception.

So, in a world of national (in)security, the new arms race is on. Buckle up.

The new goggles have dramatically improved marksmanship, Lt. Gen. James Richardson, deputy commander of Army Futures Command, recently told Congress.

The goggles can display the weapon’s aim point and can be linked to see video or virtual feeds from other positions, allowing troops to accurately shoot around corners without exposing their heads.

An armored brigade combat team deploying to South Korea will be the first to use the new goggles, according to Army Times.

The FLIR Black Hornet III is a pocket-sized drone that will perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in combat. The 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, already has the drones, which come in a pair — one for daytime and one enabling night vision. The drones are about 6 inches long and can fit on a soldier’s utility belt. The Army hopes to equip every soldier with the drones in the future.

Many might protest when hearing this. After all, the U.S. still produces the most when measured at market exchange rates. But this comparison is misleading, because things cost different amounts in different countries.

Gross domestic product is supposed to measure the amount of real stuff -- cars, phones, financial services, back massages, etc. -- that a country produces. If the same phone costs $400 in the U.S. but only $200 in China, China’s GDP is getting undercounted by 50 percent when we measure at market exchange rates. In general, less developed countries have lower prices, which means their GDP gets systematically undercounted.

Economists try to correct for this with an adjustment called purchasing power parity, which controls for relative prices. It’s not perfect, since it has to account for things like product quality, which can be hard to measure. But it probably gives a more accurate picture of how much a country really produces. And here, China has already surpassed the U.S.

If you don’t trust the murky PPP adjustments, a simple alternative is just to look at the price of a Big Mac. The same burger costs 1.8 times more in the U.S. than in China. Adjusting the market-exchange-rate GDP numbers by that ratio would put China even farther ahead.

In some dimensions, China’s lead is even larger. The country’s manufacturing output overtook that of the U.S. almost a decade ago. Its exports are more than a third larger as well.

American commentators may be slow to recognize China’s economic supremacy, but the rest of the world is starting to wake up to the fact.

This doesn’t mean China’s population is the world’s richest -- far from it. The countries with the highest income per person, in order, are Qatar, Luxembourg, Singapore, Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. But few would argue that Qatar or Luxembourg is the world’s leading economy -- while per-capita numbers are important for the well-being of a nation’s people, they don’t translate into comprehensive national power unless a country also has a large population.

China’s modest per-person income simply means that the country has plenty of room to grow. Whereas developed countries can only get richer by inventing new things or making their economies more efficient, poor countries can cheaply copy foreign technology or imitate foreign organizational practices. That doesn’t always happen, of course -- many poor countries find themselves trapped by dysfunctional institutions, lack of human capital or other barriers to development.

But there’s good reason to think that China will overcome at least some of these obstacles. Economists Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung have a new paper comparing the histories of Japan and South Korea -- both of which climbed out of poverty to achieve rich-country status -- with the recent rise of China. They find that China’s institutions are, broadly speaking, developing along the same path followed by its successful neighbors.

In other words, not only is China already the world’s largest economy, the gap between it and the U.S. can be expected to grow even wider. This continues to be borne out in the growth statistics -- though China has slowed in recent years, its economy continues to expand at a rate of more than 6 percent, while the U.S. is at just over 2 percent. If that disparity persists, China’s economy will be double that of the U.S. in less than two decades.

So economically, China has surpassed the U.S., and is on track to zoom far ahead in the near future. But what about military power? Here, it still looks like the U.S. reigns supreme. It spends more money on its military than China, has a larger nuclear arsenal, and -- thanks to its recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- has a more seasoned fighting force as well.

But that doesn’t mean that the U.S. would win a war, if the two countries fought. A full nuclear exchange, of course, would have no winners. But in a protracted conventional struggle, there’s a good chance that China’s weight of numbers and manufacturing prowess would win out. As an analogy, consider the U.S. and Japan in World War II. At the beginning of the war, Japan’s aircraft carrier force outnumbered that of the U.S., and its navy was far more seasoned (due to Japan’s war in China). But when the war began, the U.S. greatly outproduced its opponent.

The U.S. also had a 2-to-1 manpower advantage. When two countries of similar technology levels fight, numbers tend to tell. China has a larger GDP, more manufacturing output and four times the population. And as its recent advances in stealth technology, directed energy weapons, hypersonic missiles and other areas demonstrate, its military technology isn’t that far behind the U.S. In a drawn-out war, once the mighty Chinese steamroller got moving, it would be unstoppable.

In other words, China is now in a position similar to that of the U.S. at about the turn of the 20th century -- a formidable superpower that just hasn’t yet felt any reason to exercise its dominance. Once the U.S. woke up to the need to throw its weight around, no one doubted its primacy.

China may never make the same decision. It may choose to remain restrained on the international stage, with a modest nuclear arsenal and a light footprint in global institutions. If so, its dominance will remain a lurking, looming potentiality instead of a real and present fact of life.

But I wouldn’t count on that happening.

700590,"The voice on the handset says “We are in two-way contact,” and the scientists gathered respond with cheers. The operations team has just confirmed that the spacecraft, OSIRIS-REx, is alive and healthy. It had been buzzing the Earth as planned, a mere 34,448 miles above the planet’s surface and too close for contact, this spacecraft the size of a UPS truck coursing along at 19,000 miles per hour. After 55 minutes of radio silence, it was now singing, outbound from Earth and on a new trajectory to an alien world. The plan had worked: The Earth gravity assist, as it is called, was a success. It is Friday, September 22, 2017. One year ago, OSIRIS-REx launched from Florida for the asteroid Bennu. Spacecraft rarely, however, make direct flights from one world to another. To save fuel, they swing around the solar system, borrowing the gravity of other celestial objects to adjust speed and direction. OSIRIS-REx’s trajectory took it from Earth, around the sun, and back to Earth for this, its second launch of sorts. The spacecraft plowed into the wash of southern Earth’s gravity, flying nearest to Australia and Antarctica before whipping under and up, physics firing it from the solar system’s orbital plane and sending it racing for rendezvous with Bennu.

Once it arrives, OSIRIS-REx will map every meter of the asteroid, record its resources, and eventually grab a sample to bring back home. Bennu is a pristine chunk of the ancient solar system, nudged near Earth over the last 4 billion years by happenstance and orbital mechanics. By understanding Bennu, planetary scientists can get a grip on how a swirling cloud of dust and gas could coalesce into a solar system capable of creating life. Our solar system is only 4.6 billion years old; Bennu, then, is like a wormhole to the beginning of us. * * * Here at the Michael Drake Building of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, voices from spacecraft operations continue conversing across the VOCA (the Voice Operational-Communications Assembly, a sort of secure phone for teams to talk), and Estelle Church, the team’s science-systems engineer here temporarily from Lockheed Martin, turns to her computer. The spacecraft dashboard on-screen begins populating with updated telemetry data. Temperatures, currents, voltages, instrument states—down the line, everything is nominal. Church works alongside Sara Knutson, the mission’s lead science-operations engineer, who is overseeing the science side of the maneuver. There was practically zero chance that the spacecraft might be destroyed or auger into the Earth during the gravity assist: The laws of physics would not have allowed it. But the onboard computer might have announced an anomaly, or the spacecraft itself might have gone into “safe mode” (in the same way that desktop computers can at home), leaving engineers to puzzle together what happened. OSIRIS-REx could rewrite the history of the solar system. In space exploration, everything builds on what has come before. When OSIRIS-REx flew by the Earth, all of its instruments were switched off, preventing any data collection in the moments of passing. The instruments didn’t have to be off, but back when NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which is now circling Jupiter, performed its own Earth gravity assist in 2013, it swept Terra with its science payload plugging away. Its computer got tripped up, and the spacecraft went to sleep. Juno wasn’t hotdogging with its flyby—opportunistic science is part of every space mission—and the spacecraft did recover, but a lesson was learned. OSIRIS-REx kept its complement cold for its brief dance with Earth’s gravity, and would study our home only afterward.

Now, with Earth growing smaller by the second for the speeding spacecraft, the scientists are free to reactivate the instruments to commence a science-observation campaign. They warm up its instruments and train them on the Earth for calibration and data collection. Our planet is perfect for this, because scientists have a solid grip on its fundamentals. If there are odd variations between known Earth data and those collected by OSIRIS-REx, the instrument teams can make adjustments accordingly. Perhaps the most exciting science to be performed today involves the camera. The team hopes to get a clear “pale-blue dot” shot of the Earth. OSIRIS-REx will arrive at Bennu next August, which means less than one year remains for the team to refine their processes and learn their instruments not as simulations, but as functioning machines of science. For 13 years now, they have attempted to think through and rehearse every contingency, and cultivate a solid workflow for science and operations. Dante Lauretta, who leads the mission as its principal investigator and who, along with the late Michael Drake of the University of Arizona, conceived the mission and made it a reality, says that if every policy, procedure, and lesson learned were printed out, it would be millions of pages long. And yet Bennu remains inscrutable, a wholly uncooperative celestial object. Nobody knows what, exactly, they will find there. Scientists have the broad strokes, following a rigorous astronomical campaign: They understand its density, rotation, and size (its diameter is about the height of the Empire State Building). It is known to be a carbon-rich. But the asteroid’s Wikipedia entry is shorter even than that of Asteroids, the arcade game from 1979. Even Bennu’s shape remains a mystery. It appears from telescopes to look vaguely like a walnut, but some screwy surprise could scrap shelves of strategy.

Lauretta has built into the arrival phase of the mission a “regrouping” period, so that the team will have time to step back and take in this entirely new and inscrutable object. This has to be done right. NASA scientists have never before had an opportunity to grab a boxful of the primitive solar system and bring it back home. Conceivably, OSIRIS-REx could rewrite the history of the solar system and help explain the mystery of the origin of life. If the mission fails, it might be decades, if ever, before NASA attempts a repeat. * * * Hours after the Earth gravity assist, the hallways of the Michael Drake Building feel like an Aaron Sorkin movie. Mounted to a wall in the lobby is a digital countdown clock labeled TIME UNTIL EARTH GRAVITY ASSIST. Just after launch last year, it read 374 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 59.9 seconds. It now reads 000 00 00 00.0. When team members aren’t working, they’re walking and talking or huddled in hallways and doorways discussing the flyby. The images. Prospects and possibilities for the data returned. What might we learn about this third planet from the sun? some joke. Is it habitable? Will there be water? But the spacecraft might indeed return usable earth-science data. The only question presently answerable is whether or not the team will come into the office after midnight and set about studying the data, or wait for more civilized hours of the morning. The scientists seem galvanized by the prospects of doing real science with a real spacecraft and an instrument payload that they conceived and carried to construction. “There is some unknown unknown, some little wrinkle, that is going to show up.” “This is the first opportunity that we’re going to have to really exercise our software that is intended to do mapping,” says Dani DellaGiustina, a senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “We can use other missions’ data to practice running our software, but the images are a different size, or the images might have different metadata. The cameras are different. This is really the first test of our mapping software that we’re going to have using [the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite] images.”

DellaGiustina is equally interested in what might go wrong, because better to encounter it now than at Bennu. “The thing I’ve come to realize is that there is some unknown unknown, some little wrinkle, that is going to show up. The more opportunities we have to collect data and push it to our software and look at it, we’re going to uncover some things—about camera behavior, about software, about assumptions in terms of data latency or processing time—that we just hadn’t even thought about.” The Earth-observation campaign will also help Lauretta, Knutson, DellaGiustina, and other mission managers calibrate the team. Though they’ve worked together for years, plans today become operations. Planetary-science missions are notoriously taxing. Once at Bennu, the scientists of OSIRIS-REx will be running operations every day for two years on Bennu time, which does not recognize U.S. holidays or weekends. They will at the same time be publishing papers and reporting results. Such a relentless pace can fracture even the most solid and smoothly polished of teams, which makes today’s maneuver a second launch for the group itself as well as for the spacecraft: For the first time, they will use OSIRIS-REx to study an actual planetary object. (The one on which we live.) The next time they do this will be at Bennu. “You can solve the engineering and you can solve the science, but solving the people is hard,” says Jason Dworkin, the project scientist of OSIRIS-REx out of NASA Goddard Space-Flight Center in Maryland. “You need the right people. You need to feed them the right information. You need to give them the right environment, and leave them alone enough to do their brilliant work. People have different cultures and different ways of getting along.”

OSIRIS-REx has a large travel budget to help with this. “Having lunch together is more important than it sounds,” Dworkin says. “There’s something intimate and primal about sharing a meal that allows you to push through disagreements. Being able to have common jokes. These very human things help us in times of crisis.” * * * The question on everyone’s mind today is whether OSIRIS-REx will get a clear image of our home planet. The camera suite was designed for Bennu, one of the darkest objects in the solar system. (It is about the color of highway asphalt.) The Earth and its swirling white clouds, patchwork continents, and azure oceans might be a bit too much. The whole image might be washed out. This wouldn’t be a disaster from a scientific standpoint, but it would be a huge disappointment for everyone involved. On a spiritual level, that first image is everything. Just after 6:00 that evening, a skeleton group of 15 scientists and engineers gather around the conference room table in the ops room (the “doughnut distribution center,” where communal pastries are shared every Friday morning over informal conversations that shape the course of space exploration). Among those present are Lauretta, DellaGiustina, Knutson, and Church. Some are seated, some are standing, the anxiety of the moment preventing any real commitment one way or another. After months of planning, you can’t just dial up from your apartment while waiting for your TV dinner. The images are still on the spacecraft, so Church is monitoring its data from her computer—one of a dozen on the table, some open, some closed—and instant messaging her colleagues at Lockheed Martin in Denver for the status of the downlink. (Lockheed runs spacecraft operations. University of Arizona runs the science operations. NASA Goddard unifies and helps coordinate and manage the mission.) Projected on one wall of the ops room is proprietary software that will receive the science data. It should let us know when the image is ready to view.

“We’re on 25 right now,” says Church, drumming her fingers on her laptop. She is referring to the transmitting dish on the Deep Space Network, NASA’s communications array used to talk with each of its spacecraft scattered throughout the solar system. “California?” asks Lauretta. “Goldstone, yeah.” The room thrums with conversation and undirected energy, everyone sharing inside jokes and old war stories, what it was like receiving the first image from the spacecraft MESSENGER as it orbited Mercury and the first image from Phoenix at Mars. There’s no scientific or professional reason for this assembly: Those present could have connected through secure VPNs at home, or waited until the downlink completed in the predawn hours, or waited until tomorrow for the grand unveiling at a 9:00 a.m. meeting in an auditorium area they call the Pit. But after months of planning, a year of waiting, and a decade-plus of convincing the scientific community and selling NASA, of development and fabrication, of setbacks and scrapped plans and all-nighters and breakthroughs, you can’t just dial up from your apartment while waiting for your TV dinner to be ready. “Okay, it should be coming down,” says Church. Engineering data will arrive first, and afterward, it should take a few minutes for each image to arrive: The spacecraft snapped dozens over a few hours. The energy of the room intensifies, and the scientists discuss camera fields of view and what to expect of this first image. After 13 years of planning, everyone has to know all of this already, but what else can you discuss? The bit counts projected on the wall tick torpidly upward when they tick at all. Church types with a kind of gleeful aggressiveness and takes quick breaths. They exhibit the sort of reverence that causes one to step forward rather than back. The team members break the tension with jokes about colleagues doing Facebook Live (the sort of outreach now part of every NASA mission in recent years) and facetiously ascribe any subsequent personal faults to their newfound Hollywood attitudes. (“Process your images? Yeah right—I’m basking in my likes!”) They discuss Pen-Rex, the mission’s stuffed penguin-disguised-as-a-tyrannosaurus-rex mascot, and how she figures in possible Lockheed motives for slowing the downlink. (“Give us Pen-Rex if you want the data!”) “This is the longest five minutes of my life,” Church says.

The image comes without warning despite our having been warned, despite our having been waiting for more than 30 minutes now. It appears first on Church’s laptop, and we know this because she shrieks and laughs.“Oh my god! Wow!” Though it is on her computer, it is not, for whatever reason, on the massive projection at the front of the room, where it should be. Every seat in the room empties as though a fire has broken out, and scientist and engineers fall over themselves to see what she is seeing. There is a unanimous gasp. On her screen is the planet Earth, real and true. Some spontaneously clap, for our home planet and for the team, and the clapping grows to applause. We have to see it on the big screen. This room of engineers—men and women who built a giant space robot with the grace of a hummingbird—are reaching for the HDMI cable to plug it into Church’s computer, and six distinct hands are trying to help, lifting the laptop and guiding the cable and finding the port, and they’re trying to get it attached so we can see it on the big screen. They’re trying to force it into the USB port, and it is gleeful chaos until the technology is at last managed. The HDMI cable is negotiated, and the image isn’t even on the screen yet, and already there is more applause and cheering, at this technical triumph, we’re doing this thing, it is happening, and the screen is blue and then, at once, there it is. There was no guarantee that all the work would pay off, and yet there Earth is. “Wow, you guys ...”"
3576960,"caption Peresvet laser system source Russian Defense Ministry

The Peresvet combat laser, a weapon Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted about earlier this year, has entered experimental combat service with the Russian armed forces.

The laser is said to be able to destroy targets “within fractions of a second,” but Russia has been quiet about what the weapon actually does.

A new Russian laser weapon designed to instantly obliterate targets entered military service over the weekend, the Russian defense ministry revealed.

Russia’s Peresvet laser system, named after the medieval warrior monk Alexander Peresvet, entered experimental combat duty on December 1, the Russian defense ministry’s official Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper reported Wednesday.

The military began taking possession of the first shipments last year as part of Russia’s ongoing military modernization program, according to The Moscow Times, and there is speculation the lasers could shoot down incoming missiles and airplanes.

WATCH: Russia unveils Peresvet laser system

Russian President Vladimir Putin first announced the existence of this new laser weapon in March during his State of the Nation address, during which he briefly introduced the “Combat Laser Complex.”

“We have achieved significant progress in laser weapons,” he boasted, “It is not just a concept or a plan any more. It is not even in the early production stages. Since last year, our troops have been armed with laser weapons.”

“We are one step ahead our rivals,” Putin added without providing any evidence.

Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov offered a bit more information in an interview with Russian state media outlet TASS, explaining that the device could destroy targets “within fractions of a second.”

“We can talk a lot about laser weapons and movies were made about them a long time ago and fantastic books have been written, and everyone knows about this,” he introduced. “But, the fact that these systems have started entering service is indeed a today’s reality.”

The Russian defense ministry posted a video of the weapon back in July, before it had officially entered service.

Not much is publicly known about the Peresvet combat laser system, as Sputnik, a Russian media outlet controlled by the government, noted. What exactly it does has been the subject of much speculation.

“It is expected to be an air-defense system that can track and shoot down hostile aircraft and missiles,” Sputnik explained, adding, “Some suggest it will be tasked with ‘blinding’ sophisticated enemy systems, making them inoperable.”

Other countries, like the US and China, are also developing directed energy platforms.

China unveiled the LW-30, a vehicle-based laser weapon built to quickly eliminate a variety of aerial targets, at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai last month.

Experts speculated that the weapon designed by China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) could be deployed to the South China Sea."
5068366,"Northrup Grumman is among the companies tapped to make the US Army’s drone-killing lasers

Northrop Grumman is going to be working on the U.S. Army’s long-planned drone-killing lasers.

The Army wants to mount 50 kilowatt laser systems on top of its General Dynamics-designed Stryker vehicle as part of its U.S. Army Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) directed energy prototyping initiative.

Basically, the army wants to use these lasers to protect frontline combat troops against drone attacks.

The initiative includes integrating a directed energy weapon system on a Stryker vehicle as a pathfinding effort toward the U.S. Army M-SHORAD objective to provide more comprehensive protection of frontline combat units.

“Northrop Grumman is eager to leverage its portfolio of innovative, proven technologies and integration expertise to accelerate delivery of next-generation protection to our maneuver forces,” said Dan Verwiel, vice president and general manager, missile defense and protective systems, Northrop Grumman, in a statement.

The drone, helicopter, rocket, artillery and mortar defense system that the Army is looking to mount on a group of Stryker all-terrain vehicles could come from either Northrop Grumman or Raytheon, which was also tapped to develop tech for the project."
2058646,"The administration of US President Donald Trump has proposed new rules that would scale back limits on coal-fired power plants, a move critics said would have dire environmental and health consequences.

The proposal, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday, would broadly increase the leeway given to states to decide how much to regulate coal power plants.

The EPA said it ""empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.""

Tuesday`s proposal is the latest move by the current administration to roll back environmental protections put in place by Trump`s predecessor, President Barack Obama.

Combined with the EPA`s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move could increase the country`s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump`s ""Dirty Power Plan"".

{articleGUID}

Democratic Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer`s wildfires, increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already happening.

""Once again, this administration is choosing polluters` profits over public health and safety,"" he said.

Scientists said that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Senator John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration`s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

`Reviving the coal industry`

Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia, a top coal-producing state, on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country`s power producers towards less-polluting energy from natural gas, wind and solar power, among others.

Meanwhile, Trump also directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut US carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

The Supreme Court put Obama`s plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

The Trump administration is emphasizing ""coal at all costs,"" said Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed.

""They are continuing to play to their base and following industry`s lead,"" she said.

The EPA`s proposal is open for a public comment period, with a final ruling expected later this year.

Environmental groups are likely to mount a court fight against the provision that would allow states to opt out."
3057641,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia is the main suspect in U.S. agencies’ investigation of mysterious illnesses in American personnel in Cuba and China, NBC News reported on Tuesday.

Evidence from communications intercepts has pointed to Moscow’s involvement during the investigation involving the FBI, CIA and other agencies, NBC reported, citing three unidentified U.S. officials and two other people briefed on the probe.

The evidence, however, is not conclusive enough for the United States to assign blame publicly to Moscow, according to the NBC report.

FBI and CIA officials did not immediately return a request for comment on the report.

U.S. officials said in July that they are still investigating health problems at the U.S. embassy in Cuba, and do not know who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses, which began in 2016 and have affected 26 Americans.

Symptoms have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said.

The State Department said in June it brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady resembling brain injury.

Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied any involvement or knowledge of what was behind it.

The United States believes sophisticated electromagnetic weapons may have been used on government workers, possibly in conjunction with other technologies, NBC reported.

The U.S. military has been trying to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, including by testing various devices on animals, NBC said, citing Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others.

Part of the work is being done at the directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves, NBC said."
304769,"Scientists say they have more evidence that an increase in earthquakes on the Colorado-New Mexico border since 2001 has been caused by wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground, similar to human-caused quakes in Oklahoma and other states.

A paper published last week by researchers at the University of Colorado concluded that the wastewater caused a big enough increase in underground pressure to make rock formations slip along fault lines.

“You find that the pressures at any given depth are enough to trigger earthquakes,” said Jenny Nakai, the paper’s lead author and a doctoral student at the university.

The paper, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, is the latest to link wastewater injection wells to earthquakes.

Most oil and gas wells produce at least some wastewater that is too salty to use, so regulators allow energy companies to pump it back underground to get rid of it. Researchers have linked earthquakes in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas to wastewater injection.

Oklahoma had only a few dozen earthquakes of magnitude-3.0 or greater in 2012 but had more than 900 in 2015. The number dropped to closer to 600 last year after state regulators directed energy companies to close some injection wells or reduce the volume of water they inject.

In the Raton Basin of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, earthquakes began to increase in 2001, about two years after large-scale wastewater injection began, the U.S. Geological Service said. The wastewater comes from wells that extract natural gas from underground coal beds.

The biggest quake in the basin since 2001 was magnitude-5.3 in 2011. It caused minor damage to buildings in Trinidad, Colorado, about 15 miles from the epicenter.

A 2014 paper by the Geological Service blamed injection wells for the area’s quakes. The new University of Colorado study went further, using computer models and records of wastewater injection to conclude that enough pressure built up to cause the quakes.

Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the Geological Service who was the lead author of the 2014 paper, said the computer models have been used in other locations but not in the Raton Basin before now.

Rubinstein was not involved in the University of Colorado study and said he was not familiar with all its details but that the general conclusions made sense.

“It’s consistent with what my research has shown,” he said.

The University of Colorado study also found that the Raton Basin earthquakes were more widespread than previously thought, said Nakai, the lead author.

Earlier studies focused on the Colorado portion of the basin because that was the site of a 2001 swarm of 12 quakes — the strongest was magnitude-4.6 — as well as the 5.3 quake in 2011.

But seismometers recorded 1,881 quakes in the area between 2008 and 2010, and 1,442 of them were in New Mexico, Nakai said. The strongest was magnitude-3.8.

The 2008-2010 data came from a temporary deployment of seismometers as part of two other research projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Nakai said."
1545330,"San Diego hosts a rare gathering of the nation’s top military leaders.

The Chief of Naval Operations joined the commandants of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard in talking about the future of warfare.

Possible threats to America’s military superiority include rising Russia and China.

A generation of sailors and Marines who waged counterinsurgency wars overseas must adapt quickly to a changed world, where rising powers such as Russia and China threaten to usurp America’s once impervious military.

That was the urgent message delivered Thursday afternoon at San Diego’s convention center during a rare public gathering of three service leaders: Chief of Naval Operations John M. Richardson, Marine Corps commandant Gen. Robert Neller and Coast Guard commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft.

In an hourlong discussion moderated by retired Navy Adm. James G. Stavridis before a packed audience, they described the vital need for a steady funding stream to retrain and rearm services straining from nearly 17 years of constant counter-terror operations.

Hoping to avert another government shutdown, lawmakers on Capitol Hill struggled Thursday to pass a stop-gap spending measure along with a long-term budget that sends $165 billion to the Pentagon over the next two years and increased the federal debt more than $1 trillion.

Over the past decade, Congress paid the military’s bills with a series of continuing resolutions, with fewer funds for the services due to spending caps enacted in 2011’s so-called “sequestration” legislation.

“I’m hopeful that it’ll pass and it’s a lot of money,” Neller said. “But we’re going to get that money like we did last year, with about half the fiscal year left to spend it. That’s not any way to run a business.”

Although both he and Zukunft fretted about the national debt and its economic effects in coming years, Neller said that the influx of military spending was important to preserve the nation’s survival.

“The adversary out there is making big bets, big investments, in their capacity. And their capabilities have grown,” Neller said. “Whether they want to take us on or not, we have to be able to go and display the capability to deter them.”

Richardson said his top priority was revamping the Navy’s ballistic submarine fleet. The underwater Navy carries 70 percent of America’s nuclear warheads.

“Without that strategic deterrent, we’re really in a different world,” said Richardson, a career submariner and the former director of the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program. “Everything becomes impossibly harder. That’s got to succeed.”

Neller said the Navy needs more attack subs, too. The fleet is supposed to deploy 66 of them but today there are only 50 left, a number expected to fall to 43 before shipyards begin churning out two Virginia-class replacements annually in the next decade.

The silent hunters of the deep sail ahead of carrier and amphibious strike groups, sniffing out enemy subs and spying on a foe’s battle fleets.

“We need more attack submarines, OK? I need to get where I’m going,” Neller said.

“When was the last time we had to fight to get to the fight? We just went. We didn’t have to fight to get there,” he continued, pointing to the guerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“We’re going to have to fight to get to the fight.”

Once in the thick of battle, Neller will need newer aircraft, swapping out his aging fleet with fifth-generation jets, tilt-rotor vehicles and high-tech helicopters.

He also wants more reliable and resilient command and control systems. That’s the technology that helps Marines know where their units are in relation to the enemy, clearing the fog of war. The challenge is keeping those networks up while the foe tries to jam, degrade or destroy them.

“We’re trying to create a modern Marine Corps,” Neller said. “The stuff we have we take good care of, but there are Marines over here wrenching on vehicles older than they are.”

Watching an increasingly wealthy Beijing build increasingly sophisticated warships, aircraft and missiles, Richardson said the Pentagon needs to reform the procurement process so that the Navy can more quickly and cheaply deploy vessels.

To contain costs, those ships need smaller crews but can make up the difference with better automated systems, sensors and weapons packing a more powerful punch from longer distances, he added.

They’ll be helped by underwater and aerial drones, plus new directed energy weapons like lasers, he said, but Congress also has mandated a 355-ship Navy.Today he can deploy 280. The problem is America’s industrial base. Shipbuilding capacity today is a third of what the Navy could get in 1955.

“There are 14 shipyards that build ships that shuttered or got out of the defense business,” Richardson said. “So you can see these two conflicting trends — the need to grow the number of ships and yet we just don’t have the industrial capacity to do it.”

Although Zukunft is finally getting the first large icebreaker built for the Coast Guard in four decades, his aging fleet of patrol boats on inland waterways struggles to keep $4.6 trillion in American commerce flowing.

Modern replacements will cost more than $15 million each but the commandant needs them to cost less to maintain and fuel, saving money in the long run.

“Some are 73 years old now,” he said. “It’s not a huge ask but it’s a huge return on investment.”

WASHINGTON — Intelligence agencies investigating mysterious ""attacks"" that led to brain injuries in U.S. personnel in Cuba and China consider Russia to be the main suspect, three U.S. officials and two others briefed on the investigation tell NBC News.

The suspicion that Russia is likely behind the alleged attacks is backed up by evidence from communications intercepts, known in the spy world as signals intelligence, amassed during a lengthy and ongoing investigation involving the FBI, the CIA and other U.S. agencies. The officials declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence.

The evidence is not yet conclusive enough, however, for the U.S. to formally assign blame to Moscow for incidents that started in late 2016 and have continued in 2018, causing a major rupture in U.S.-Cuba relations.

Since last year, the U.S. military has been working to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, according to Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others briefed on the investigation, including by testing various devices on animals. As part of that effort, the U.S. has turned to the Air Force and its directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and advanced laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves.

Although the U.S. believes sophisticated microwaves or another type of electromagnetic weapon were likely used on the U.S. government workers, they are also exploring the possibility that one or more additional technologies were also used, possibly in conjunction with microwaves, officials and others involved in the government`s investigation say.

The U.S. has said 26 government workers were injured in unexplained attacks at their homes and hotels in Havana starting in late 2016, causing brain injuries, hearing loss and problems with cognition, balance, vision and hearing problems. Strange sounds heard by the workers initially led investigators to suspect a sonic weapon, but the FBI later determined sound waves by themselves couldn`t have caused the injuries.

This year, one U.S. worker in China was diagnosed with similar symptoms after hearing bizarre sounds in Guangzhou, and more from China are being tested.

Painful to see how @NBCNews echoes others to mount speculation without evidence, using dark sources. Is there any balance? Where are #Cuba sources? https://t.co/aNKA3VfBvu — José Ramón Cabañas (@JoseRCabanas) September 12, 2018

It is fair to ask why NBC would lend itself to such a dangoeorus game. #Cuba does not act and does not allow anyone to act aganist the diplomats of any country in its territory. Thorough investigations by Cuba an US law enforcemente agencies discard any weapon. — Carlos F. de Cossio (@CarlosFdeCossio) September 12, 2018

The precise motive remains unclear, but the incidents have driven a wedge between the U.S. and Cuba that has led Washington to remove most of its diplomats and spies from the island. Early in the investigation, senior U.S. officials raised the possibility the illnesses were unintended consequences of some new spying technology. But the fact the incidents continued long after they became publicly known has cast doubt on the possibility that the damage was accidental.

In testimony before Congress last week, State Department officials were unanimous that the incidents should be considered ""attacks.""

""The State Department has come to the determination that they were attacks,"" Ambassador Peter Boode, who leads the task force responding to the incidents, told a House Foreign Affairs Committee panel.

A U.S. official separately tells NBC News that the U.S. has ""no reason to believe this was anything but an intentional act.""

If Russia did use a futuristic weapon to damage the brains of U.S. personnel, it would mark a stunning escalation in Russian aggression toward Western nations, compounded recently by the use of a military-grade nerve agent to poison an ex-spy and his daughter in Britain. Although the full extent of the resulting diplomatic fallout is difficult to predict, a determination that Russia was behind the Cuba attacks would trigger outrage in Congress and foreign capitals and calls for an immediate, concerted response, especially as President Donald Trump faces continued questions about his willingness to challenge Russia and President Vladimir Putin.

Russian government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, ""The investigation is ongoing. We have made no determination on who or what is responsible for the health attacks.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.

After initial publication of this story, Cuban officials blasted it as irresponsible via Twitter. Carlos de Cossio, director general of the Cuban Foreign Ministry`s U.S. Department, tweeted, ""Cuba does not act and does not allow anyone to act against the diplomats of any country in its territory."" Cuban ambassador to the U.S. Jose Ramon Cabanas said it was ""painful to see how NBC News echoes others to mount speculation without evidence, using dark sources. … Where are Cuba sources?""

On Cuban television, de Cossio said the U.S. has not produced any objective evidence that attacks of any kind occurred in Cuba, and that the ""scientific community"" has rejected successive U.S. theories about the source of the alleged attacks. ""The way in which the United States government has dealt with this matter of the supposed health damages to its diplomats is worrisome,"" he said. ""From the beginning, it has been handled with a high dose of political manipulation. For more than a year and a half, the State Department has launched specific accusations against Cuba without any evidence whatsoever supporting those claims and without any credibility.""

The strong U.S. suspicion that Russia is behind the incidents means that Cuba`s government is no longer considered the likely culprit. Still, officials did not rule out the possibility that the Cuban intelligence services may have offered the Russians some level of cooperation or tacit consent. Russian intelligence agencies operate in force in Cuba, as do Chinese spies, officials say.

Cuba`s government has repeatedly denied any knowledge of or involvement in attacks on Americans in Cuba, and has argued there is no evidence the attacks even took place. The U.S. maintains that whoever perpetrated the attacks, Cuba bears responsibility for failing to protect U.S. diplomats on Cuban soil.

Although the U.S. has never disclosed their identities, officials tell NBC News that in addition to State Department diplomats, the victims include multiple CIA officers, at least one member of the U.S. military, and representatives of other agencies."

4320740,"P ATRICK SHANAHAN draws his finger down a list of his priorities for the Pentagon: hypersonics, directed energy, space, cyber, quantum science and autonomy. It could not be further from the dusty battlegrounds of the past 18 years. “When we talk about space, this is not designed for counter-terrorism,” he says. Mr Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, was propelled into the job of secretary of defence in January, having served as understudy to James Mattis for less than 18 months. He has taken the helm of an organisation that is in the throes of change, as it prepares for life after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In January 2018 the Trump administration published its National Defence Strategy ( NDS ). Officials lamented that nearly two decades of whack-a-mole against insurgents and jihadists had eroded the country’s military edge, resulting in exhausted and under-trained units armed for the wrong enemy. So the NDS decreed that America would henceforth focus on “long-term, strategic competition between nations”—namely, China and Russia. Mr Shanahan was charged with implementing the vision while Mr Mattis travelled around the world calming ruffled allies.

“This is the first time since the Reagan era where the United States has been motivated to modernise its war-fighting architecture, its technologies,” says Michael Griffin, the Pentagon’s technology chief. “The first time we’ve been forced to think about how we fight war.”

One priority is to re-tool the armed forces with the weapons they need. Mr Griffin paints a picture of each service wielding its own ultra-fast and long-range hypersonic missiles, fed information from a vast satellite network girdling the skies, all of it supported by a procurement process that can spit out high-tech weapons in years rather than decades.

David Norquist, Mr Shanahan’s acting deputy and the Pentagon’s finance chief, points to rising investments in firepower-heavy platforms, like the Virginia-class submarine and new B 21 bomber. But he also acknowledges that big planes and ships may not survive for long under a hailstorm of Chinese or Russian missiles. So money is also going to larger numbers of smaller, cheaper and dispersible platforms—like an unmanned boat.

The second priority is ensuring that the armed forces not only have the arms they need, but also the training and readiness to use them in the sort of fighting they would face in eastern Europe and the western Pacific. Disaster relief is nice, says one general, but “this is a warfighting operation.” Ryan McCarthy, undersecretary of the army, says that half his brigade combat teams—freed from what was an intense pace of deployments—are now at the highest level of readiness, up from a small fraction of that two years ago. Basic training is being increased from 14 to 22 weeks.

Training and exercise scenarios are adapting, too. They increasingly reflect “large force-on-force conflict against very high-end adversaries,” says John Rood, the Pentagon’s policy chief. Soldiers who once practised dealing with terrorists’ roadside bombs now drill in dodging enemy air strikes or chemical weapons. The army is raising new battalion-sized forces, one apiece for Russia and China, which integrate cyber, electronic warfare and space capabilities—skills that were lost or neglected in the counter-insurgency years.

A third focus is changing what the Pentagon actually does with its troops, planes and ships. “The basic concept”, says Mr Rood, “is that we’re going to give priority to the Indo-Pacific.” He points out that 2018 saw the longest absence of an aircraft carrier from the Persian Gulf since 2001; two carriers were instead sent to the Pacific.

A working group at the joint staff has been poring through 150-odd “global execution orders” (directives to commanders around the world) that have accumulated over the years, weeding out those which do not fit with the NDS ’s focus on great power competition. Seven out of eight advise-and-assist missions in Africa Command have already been cut. Central Command, which covers everything from Egypt to Pakistan, will have more fat shaved off.

But rebalancing is only part of the story. The most significant element of the NDS , says Mr Shanahan, is “dynamic force employment” ( DFE in mil-speak). That refers to moving forces around the world quickly and unpredictably to bamboozle adversaries. Last year, for instance, the USS Harry S. Truman, an aircraft-carrier that usually hangs around the Middle East, was abruptly called home midway through her deployment cycle and then suddenly sailed into the Arctic Circle—the first carrier to do so in 27 years—to join massive NATO exercises. For a carrier, whose movements are planned years ahead, that is warp-speed. Similar surprise deployments of bombers, fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles are being planned under DFE .

Despite all this, insiders grumble that civilians have not forced services to change spending patterns drastically enough. Rear-Admiral Mark Montgomery, former policy director for the Senate Armed Services Committee, is concerned that the army is still buying too many vehicles initially designed for low-end war, such as light tanks. Chris Brose, the committee’s former staff director, says the Pentagon is not doing anywhere near enough to develop, build and test the huge numbers of autonomous, unmanned systems it needs.

Mr Shanahan urges sceptics to wait for the 2020 budget, which he has called “a masterpiece”. “What you’ll see in these budgets is a sizeable investment in these critical technologies and programmes, whether it’s autonomy, artificial intelligence, hypersonics, cyber. The critics haven’t had exposure to those plans yet.” He adds, coyly, that “there’s a good portion of the budget you won’t ever see”, implying that more radical efforts may be buried in classified spending. And he is confident that he can remould a 700,000-strong bureaucracy. “People like myself, we spend our whole life implementing. We know how to move large organisations. We know where to place our bets.”"
3066350,"EXCLUSIVE: Doctors Reveal Details of Neuro-Weapon Attacks in Havana

Directed energy weapons intended to disrupt or damage their victims’ brains were the most likely source of a series of mysterious attacks singling out U.S. personnel assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2017, three doctors involved in the investigation have told National Defense in exclusive interviews.



The three experts were contacted by the State Department to investigate 25 cases of government employees working in Cuba who complained of suddenly hearing noises, pressure in their ears, followed by symptoms such as headaches, vertigo, dizziness and loss of cognitive functions.



The team of three experts concluded that incident was a widescale use of electronics to carry out a so-called neuro-weapon attack. Neuro-weapons are an emerging, but little understood threat that is compounded by the ease in which they can be purchased on the internet.



“I think we are turning a page,” said Dr. James Giordano, a professor at the departments of neurology and biochemistry at Georgetown University Medical Center and chief of the Neuroethics Studies Program at the Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics. The Pentagon has taken notice of the event and Giordano and the two other team members will be briefing the J3, joint chiefs of staff, on Sept. 7.

Neuro-weapons can take the form of biological agents, chemical weapons — and in the Havana case — directed energy, and possibly a combination of different methods, Giordano said. The effects can be latent, durable, highly disruptive and attribution is difficult. They are not “weapons of mass destruction,” but they have the potential to disrupt everything from individual cells in a body, to societies and geopolitics, said Giordano, who authored a 2014 book, Neurotechnology in National Security and Defense: Practical Considerations, Neuroethical Concerns.

The attacks occurred at the victims’ homes, with the exception of two cases that took place in a hotel known to accommodate diplomats and other U.S. personnel, said Dr. Michael Hoffer, director of the Vestibular and Balance Program at the University of Miami’s Department of Otolaryngology. Hoffer was the first physician to examine the victims on site in Cuba, and later in Miami.



“I thought they were being targeted. I still believe they were being targeted,” he said. Those he examined said they were sitting in their homes, or the hotel, when they suddenly felt the symptoms: a loud noise exposure, a pressure sensation, ear pain, then ringing in the ears and dizziness. A day later there were some cognitive deficits reported.



“They would actually say that if they moved in their domicile, the beam — as it were — would follow them. Except the minute they opened the front door, it went off,” Hoffer said.



Hoffer carried out a series of preliminary tests on 100 personnel assigned to the embassy last summer, as well as 10 people who were in the same residences of the victims at the time of the attack, but in other rooms. No symptoms were found in the 100 other employees.



Being in Havana shortly after the attacks and before news had reached the media was important because it gave Hoffer valuable insights, he said. Other than speaking to one another about the symptoms, the victims were not influenced by newspaper accounts. In addition, he arrived relatively soon after the attacks when their memories of what happened were fresh, and none of them had received any medical treatment.



He also had the opportunity to see where the incidents occurred. “I literally looked and walked at the places that were hit,” he said.



Most of the victims also worked in a particular part of the embassy, he added. “They were really good at targeting,” he said of those who carried out the attacks. The homes were clustered in certain neighborhoods where diplomats reside, he added.



“People were hit from all branches of the State Department, but certain branches were hit more than others,” he said.

Thirty-five potential victims — the 25 who reported symptoms plus the 10 who were in the residences at the same time — were flown to Miami where an interdisciplinary team of experts from the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine carried out a battery of more detailed tests.



Hoffer was able to quickly rule out the possibility that they had experienced a traumatic brain injury, or TBI. As a retired Navy captain and doctor, he had examined more than 3,000 service members who had experienced TBI and that was not it. Plus, none of the victims had reported injuring their head.



The team recorded “objective findings of balance disorders” on 100 percent of the 25 victims, who had reported the symptoms. Everyone was abnormal in at least one balance test. “We made sure they were ‘super’ abnormal not just ‘barely’ abnormal, Hoffer said. The 10 people who were in the same buildings at the time of the attacks showed no symptoms.



The 25 victims also had a unique pattern of cognitive disorders that the co-lead of the team, the university’s director of neuropsychology Dr. Bonnie Levin, picked up, he said.



Giordano said directed energy weapons can cause these injuries by creating “cavitation,” or air pockets, in fluids near the inner ear. The shape of the inner ear amplifies sounds and waveforms to cause the effect. The process creates air bubbles, or cavities, that eventually burst.



Near the inner ear are two pathways carrying blood to the brain — the cochlear aqueduct and the vestibular aqueduct. The bubbles can travel rapidly up the aqueducts into the brain where they can “function as a stroke,” Giordano said.



There were 19 complete sets of data derived from the 25 victims after the University of Miami team completed the tests. The State Department put Hoffer together in a team with Giordano and Dr. Carey Balaban, a professor of otolaryngology, bioengineering, neurobiology and communication and science disorders, at the University of Pittsburgh.



The three independently examined all the data using different approaches, but came to the same conclusions. They ruled out TBI because the damage was not consistent with such injuries. Toxins such as heavy metals or high doses of certain medications that cause similar inner ear problems were not present, and the damage not consistent.



Balaban, who works with the Office of Naval Research, was familiar with a body of scientific research, mostly conducted by ONR from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, on directed energy weapons and their effects on the inner ear. The research sought to identify the human head’s susceptibility to directed energy exposures. The papers helped form part of his conclusions.



“The likelihood of multiple sources of energy of acoustic and radio frequencies … is there, we just don’t know what it was,” he said.



The team could not conclude exactly what method the perpetrators used on the victims, but narrowed it down to several possibilities: drugs alone was deemed “unlikely.” Ultrasonic (acoustic) exposures they judged “very possible and likely.” Electromagnetic pulsing was also rated “very possible and probable.” Microwave energy was deemed possible, but “unlikely.”



There was another possibility — but more information was needed to know — that the attackers used a combination of a drug that was activated by the directed energy weapon.



Balaban said there was another possible method: pulsed lasers. “Near infrared lasers penetrate pretty far into the head,” he said. “All of these weapons can produce cavitation in fluids and can produce these effects,” he added. The three team members agreed that “saying [the Cuba attacks] are one thing or another is foolhardy,” Balaban said.



“Can we know who did it? I’m not quite sure. Do we know what they were exposed to? Hard to tell. But it points out this [knowledge] gap that we need to fill,” Balaban said.



The case has drawn a great deal of attention within the Pentagon and at Special Operations Command, he said. The information was recently declassified and the three have given briefings to SOCOM and to the Air Force’s AFWERX. Balaban is working on a grant with ONR to reproduce the attack in a laboratory setting so it can be better understood.



The trio plans to publish a paper as soon as possible with the results for all to see. One theory is that the victims were being used as a test — basically human guinea pigs — and the perpetrators are hoping the U.S. publishes test results that can help them fine-tune or better understand how to use these weapons. Balaban said that kind of data will not be made public.



Meanwhile, “Pandora’s box is open as far as making these kinds of things,” Balaban said. Devices that can be used in ultrasonic attacks, for example, are readily available on the internet for less than $300. The off-the-shelf devices are intended to repulse vermin such as rats and insects and have a range of about 30 to 40 feet, he said.



“We are facing a threat. And an important thing is to figure out the battlespace we are dealing with here and make some solutions,” Balaban said. “It’s the perfect kind of gray warfare. It’s a very good way to degrade your opponent’s capabilities so you can exploit it with conventional means.”



Such weapons could be used clandestinely against a political leader, for example, to ultimately destabilize a society, Giordano said. “I think what you are beginning to see is a greater likelihood for targeting the brain in these ways — both in regard to its structure and its functions, which includes cognitions, emotions and behaviors — in ways that are going to be disruptive on a variety of scales from systems in the individual to systems in the social and political” realm, he said.



Balaban added: “We have a plausible set of vulnerabilities — areas we know nothing about, neuro-weapons, that have been used asymmetrically. We have to figure out what the heck this is.”

5604523,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is making a push to develop high-tech military hardware that would give it control over critical defense capabilities and lessen reliance on imports.

Wary of threats from rival Iran, and concerned over moves by some allies to hold up arms sales, the UAE is reshaping a military industry already seen as the region’s most sophisticated.

State defense companies have been brought together to form EDGE, a $5-billion conglomerate to spearhead development of advanced weapons for the country’s military.

Those ambitions were put on display at this week’s Dubai Airshow where the military handed an EDGE company a $1 billion contract for guided missiles.

“Like many countries, on specific critical capabilities you want to have sovereignty,” EDGE Chief Executive Faisal al-Bannai told Reuters.

The UAE’s defense industry dates back two decades, built through joint ventures and technology transfer programs.

Much of it now sits under EDGE, manufacturing drones, small ammunitions and providing maintenance.

Despite close ties with the West, the oil-rich Gulf nation has had difficulty acquiring some sophisticated weapons.

The United States will not sell armed drones to the UAE under a longstanding export policy limiting their use. Recently, some European countries have blocked sales to the UAE over its involvement in the Yemen war.

Meanwhile, the UAE maintains close ties and continues to buy weapons from China and Russia.

Abdulla al-Hashimi, assistant undersecretary for support services at the UAE ministry of defense, said sovereign capabilities were a “necessity” for security and the economy.

EMERGING THREATS

A series of attacks in the Gulf over the summer, blamed on Iran by the United States, highlighted new threats to the security of Gulf states. Tehran denied involvement.

Oil tankers off the UAE coast were sabotaged and a swarm of missiles and drones temporarily wiped out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production in a September attack.

EDGE could develop directed energy technology, Bannai said, which can be used to counter drone threats.

Directed energy weapons emit focused energy in the form of lasers, microwaves, electromagnetic radiation, radio waves, sound or particle beams.

“The Emiratis not only believe that they can make a profit in this sphere but also that they are well-equipped to understand and counter regional threats,” said Robert Mogielnicki, a resident scholar at the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute.

The UAE is expected to spend $17 billion on defense next year, according to U.S.-based defense analysis firm Teal, up from $14.4 billion in 2014 when last disclosed by the government. Today, just a fraction is spent domestically.

Abu Dhabi, the main petroleum producing emirate, is leading the development of the country’s industry.

There, the move is seen as a step not only toward more diversification of an oil-based economy but toward “greater strategic autonomy with regards to foreign and defense policies,” said Jean-Loup Samaan, associate professor at the UAE National Defense College.

2147403,"President Donald Trump is looking at sending the US military into space with a newly invented service, the Space Force.

Combat in space is not only likely in a war scenario, but could prove highly devastating for those on earth.

Most of the fighting would likely involve missiles taking out satellites, and possibly killer satellites and lasers shooting each other down.

But a lot of the fighting would be things the US military already does, so many think it’s a dumb idea.

President Donald Trump is ordering the Pentagon to create the first new US military service branch in seven decades to establish “American dominance in space,” and while experts quickly knocked the idea as premature – there’s no doubt that space is a warfighting domain.

As it stands, the Russia and China both have tested missiles that could bring the US to its knees by crippling its satellites.

Satellites power GPS, which powers most civilian navigation and US military equipment. Satellites also time stamp transactions at US stock exchanges. Commercial satellites also relay internet, telephone, and radio communciations. The US, without its space assets, could suffer societal collapse at the hands of its rivals before a single terrestrial battle is fought.

For this reason, experts assess that space absolutely has become a warfighting domain, and one that may soon see lasers on space ships duking it out in a war above the clouds.

How a space war would go down

US Navy US Navy ships have already knocked satellites out of the sky.

“If there was a war between a US and a China, for example, each side would likely try to take away the commanding heights of space from each other,” Peter W. Singer, a strategist at non-partisan think tank New America and the author of “Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War,” told Business Insider.

But instead of starships chasing each other in dogfights and “Star Wars” like duels in zero gravity, Singer said that most of a space fight would actually take place on plain old earth, though lasers are on the table.

The US and its adversaries would fire missiles at their adversary’s satellites powering navigation and trade, possibly from traditional land launchers or from ships at sea. The US has plans to streamline the launching of satellites, and hopes any future space attacks can be thwarted by quick, cheap launches of constellations of small satellites.

Singer pointed out that the US has observed Russian “killer or kamikaze satellites” manoeuvring out in space in ways that suggest they could attack or block US satellites.

“They also might be using directed energy of some kind to either blind or damage a satellite. That directed energy might be laser, ground based or space based,” said Singer.

The real fighting is still on earth

U.S. Air Force/Technical Sgt. Cecilio Ricardo United State Cyber Command

But much of the fighting wouldn’t be as flashy as space-fired lasers knocking out killer satellites, instead, it would likely take place in a “cross between space and cyber” warfare, according to Singer.

US and rival cyber warriors would start “trying to go after the communication links between space and earth on the ground. They might be trying to jam or take control of the satellites,” he said.

But therein lies the problem.

Many in Congress have spoken out about the proposed Space Force, calling it premature. The Air Force, in its measured language, seems to hate the idea. Singer called it “absurd” and a “joke.” Retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, also a a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, and four-time space-flyer called it a “dumb idea.”

Basically, all the jobs the space force would do are already being done by the Air Force, and Navy, so making a costly new service this early into the space age could prove foolish.

“Yea space is a clear part of national security,” said Singer, “but it’s hard to imagine a better waste of time energy and budget.”

2175838,"China is preparing to start bidding on a nuclear powered icebreaker, the first nuclear powered surface ship in the country’s history. An icebreaker powered by nuclear energy would give Beijing access to the Arctic and its resources. It would also pave the way toward nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, giving the People’s Liberation Army Navy unprecedented reach.

On June 21, 2018 China National Nuclear Corporation, an arm of the Chinese government, opened up bids to shipbuilders for the country’s first nuclear powered icebreaker. According to the state-run Global Times, the winning bidder would be required to “research, appraisal, building and testing of the ship, and provide technology support” for the Chinese government.

Climate change has decreased the amount of ice in the Arctic region, leading to the possibility of alternative sea routes and the exploitation of resources previously locked away under thick sea ice. As the ice has thawed countries are positioning to become influential Arctic powers. Although China is no Norway or Canada, it still considers the Arctic a key national interest. A Chinese military expert told Global Times that the icebreaker “will enhance China`s ability to conduct scientific explorations in (Arctic) regions.”

China maintains a small fleet of icebreakers for clearing sea routes in the northern Bohai Sea but has just one large icebreaker, the 21,000 ton Xue Long (Snow Dragon) shown above. A second conventionally-powered icebreaker is under construction and the nuclear-powered ship would make a fleet of three.

Icebreakers are designed to open up routes through sea ice for explorers or commercial shipping, but they can also be trapped in ice themselves for days or weeks. Nuclear power allows icebreakers to operate in the ice without concern for a dwindling fuel supply, their limits defined by their food supplies and the endurance of their crews. The Soviet Union’s first nuclear surface ship was an icebreaker. Commissioned in 1957, the 16,000 ton Lenin was as big as a Navy cruiser.

The nuclear power plant meant to power China’s icebreaker could also power a future nuclear aircraft carrier. Although China has seagoing nuclear reactors, they power China’s nuclear submarine fleet and are fairly small. A large reactor designed for the icebreaker project could be installed in an aircraft carrier in banks of four or more, providing the energy necessary to power a 60,000 ton aircraft carrier, directed energy weapons, and electromagnetic catapults for launching aircraft. The world’s first nuclear-powered carrier, the U.S. Navy’s USS Enterprise, featured eight Westinghouse A2W nuclear reactors, although the follow-on Nimitz class consolidated the number to just two reactors."

As investigators conduct a painstaking probe for the causes of California’s devastating wildfires, conspiracists have spawned their own theory: ignition by a secret cabal of nefarious “internationalists,” including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sergey Brin, who seek to run the world.

“There are hidden powers behind these calculated strikes in California,” warns one YouTube video, titled “An Open Letter To the People of California.”

In Facebook forums, YouTube videos and Reddit threads amassing tens of thousands of views, believers swap manipulated images of “light pillars” from the sky — proof, they say, that rural homes were targeted to burn, forcing residents into cities, where they can be more easily controlled by shadowy forces scheming at oppression.

Jeff Durham/Bay Area News Group

People have long reached for far-flung theories to explain shocking calamities, such as the mysterious “grassy knoll” assassin of President John F. Kennedy and the U.S. government’s complicity in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.

Psychologists say these theories gain traction during times of trauma because they ease uncertainty, provide a platform for personal grievances and focus blame on an outside group — usually a network of “elites.” Suspicions are cradled by the internet, which allows people who share those thoughts to more easily connect.

“Whether it’s wildfires, contamination of water supply or some ‘deep state’ takeover — all these beliefs satisfy the need to make sense of a threatening and anxious world,” said psychologist Joseph A. Vitriol, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University.

There’s a new high-tech twist to the perceived plots behind California’s recent Paradise, Woolsey and Wine Country fires. Asserting that nature could never incite a fire so fast or hot, some conspiracists say images of the light pillars reveal “directed energy weaponry” that emits highly focused heat. Others say fires were ignited by drones or satellite-based lasers.

While believers are split over the precise contours of the conspiracy, they agree that “geoengineering” is behind California’s parched and flammable landscape. The state’s weather is being deliberately altered, they allege. Then aircraft dump “chemtrails” of drying agents, which are easily ignited.

Who’s behind this complex scheme? Conspiracy websites such as Infowars, run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones, claim it is a secret plot by the moneyed elite to make certain parts of the country off-limits to human use and impose control.

Widely shared maps titled “Wildfires line up EXACTLY in the same path as the California High Speed Rail System” offer evidence, the conspiracists claim, that the fires are a plot to move people out of the way for construction of the transit system, key to eventual state takeover.

(The made-up fire maps’ geography is off, showing that San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento were consumed by flames. Nor does the map line up with the train’s proposed route.)

Critics say social media companies have not stopped conspiracy theories from blossoming on their platforms. YouTube says it is committed to tackling misinformation, Facebook removed accounts that engage in “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” and Reddit banned a subreddit devoted to conspiracy theories, but sites continue to host false narratives about the fires in California.

Meanwhile, teams of highly skilled Cal Fire investigators are scouring the rugged terrain of Butte and Los Angeles counties for scientific clues to the fires — evidence that could someday aid prevention. The truth is climate change and poor forest management set the stage for these disasters, say scientists.

But that hasn’t stopped the theorists.

Former Petaluma fire Captain John Lord, who now lives in Lakeport, called the fires an “unnatural phenomenon.”

“The rate of spread is abnormally fast. … In a normal structural fire, there will always be things that are left — porcelain toilets, tiles, washers and dryers. In these fires, everything is gone,” he said.

“Planes released nanoparticles of metals, such as aluminum, into the atmosphere,” he said. “That is a drying agent, and highly combustible.”

On YouTube, a Paradise resident identified only as Cheryl described seeing “a huge corporate helicopter circling over my house … surveying the town, getting ready to grasp it.”

“The abundance of photographic and video evidence of so-called fire damage to both vehicles and structures in clear and conclusive. These November 2018 wildfires were not responsible for some of

the most catastrophic destruction,” wrote Michael Thomas, editor of State of the Nation: Alternative News, Analysis and Commentary.

To be sure, some conspiracies turned out to be real. Watergate happened. So did the Iran-Contra affair. Unbelievably, the Russian government meddled in our 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But the creatively conspiratorial, if crazy, theories hold special appeal because fires can be mysterious, said psychology professor David Ludden of Georgia Gwinnett College, who studies conspiracies.

Camp Fire: Number of missing falls to 49 “And they fit in with an existing world view that we can’t trust the government, that all these nefarious agencies are out there trying to get us,” he said. Internet sharing “creates a sense of security and superiority, of having inside knowledge that others don’t.”

Such thinking can distract the public from learning the objective reality of wildfires, making it more difficult to reduce risk, said Harvard’s Vitriol.

“It’s not just your crazy uncle in a tin foil hat, ruminating about the government,” he said. If the internet gives these ideas traction, “they spread and gain legitimacy, so they’re harder to combat.”"
3584643,"The Peresvet combat laser, a weapon Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted about earlier this year, has entered experimental combat service with the Russian armed forces.

The laser is said to be able to destroy targets ""within fractions of a second,"" but Russia has been quiet about what the weapon actually does.

A new Russian laser weapon designed to instantly obliterate targets entered military service over the weekend, the Russian defence ministry revealed.

Russia`s Peresvet laser system, named after the medieval warrior monk Alexander Peresvet, entered experimental combat duty on December 1, the Russian defence ministry`s official Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper reported on Wednesday.

The military began taking possession of the first shipments last year as part of Russia`s ongoing military modernisation programme, according to The Moscow Times, and there is speculation the lasers could shoot down incoming missiles and aircraft.

WATCH: Russia unveils Peresvet laser system

Russian President Vladimir Putin first announced the existence of this new laser weapon in March during his State of the Nation address, during which he briefly introduced the ""Combat Laser Complex.""

""We have achieved significant progress in laser weapons,"" he boasted, ""It is not just a concept or a plan any more. It is not even in the early production stages. Since last year, our troops have been armed with laser weapons.""

""We are one step ahead our rivals,"" Putin added without providing any evidence.

Deputy Defence Minister Yuri Borisov offered a bit more information in an interview with Russian state media outlet TASS, explaining that the device could destroy targets ""within fractions of a second.""

""We can talk a lot about laser weapons and movies were made about them a long time ago and fantastic books have been written, and everyone knows about this,"" he introduced. ""But, the fact that these systems have started entering service is indeed a today`s reality.""

The Russian defence ministry posted a video of the weapon back in July, before it had officially entered service.

Not much is publicly known about the Peresvet combat laser system, as Sputnik, a Russian media outlet controlled by the government, noted. What exactly it does has been the subject of much speculation.

""It is expected to be an air-defence system that can track and shoot down hostile aircraft and missiles,"" Sputnik explained, adding, ""Some suggest it will be tasked with `blinding` sophisticated enemy systems, making them inoperable.""

Other countries, like the US and China, are also developing directed energy platforms.

China unveiled the LW-30, a vehicle-based laser weapon built to quickly eliminate a variety of aerial targets, at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai last month.

Experts speculated that the weapon designed by China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) could be deployed to the South China Sea."
2555880,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday came out with new rules scaling back Obama-era constraints on coal-fired power plants, striking at one of the former administration`s legacy programs to rein in climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency called the Obama-era regulations on coal power plants ""overly prescriptive and burdensome.""

The Trump administration plan broadly increases the leeway given states to decide how and how much to regulate coal power plants. The EPA says it ""empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.""

Combined with the EPA`s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move may actually increase the country`s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump`s ""Dirty Power Plan.""

Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer`s wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. ""Once again, this administration is choosing polluters` profits over public health and safety,"" he said.

Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration`s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

The new proposal establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing any plans to limit climate-changing emissions from power plants. Critics say the new plan would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often and extend the plants` overall operating life, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry. The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country`s power producers to natural gas, wind and solar power, and other less-polluting power sources.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a ""war on coal"" waged by Obama.

""They are continuing to play to their base and following industry`s lead,"" Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed, said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. ""This is all about coal at all costs."""

She says people`s needs to talk about the movie`s ending is ""misdirected"" energy, and stems from the lack of control they feel about the world. This is something they feel they can control.

There`s at least one person not interested in seeing Paul Feig`s holiday-themed romantic comedy ""Last Christmas"" spoiled all over the internet: star Emilia Clarke.

When trailers for the new film arrived in mid-August, social media users and entertainment journalists alike picked up on more than a few hints that not everything was as it seemed to be in the film, which sees Clarke playing a prickly Londoner who is pursued by a handsome (and slightly odd) stranger in the form of Henry Golding.

Outlets published entire screeds attempting to unpack what was really happening in the Emma Thompson-scripted film and Twitter lit up with entertainment obsessives casting about their own theories about a possible twist.

Clarke, for one, wishes people weren`t trying so hard to read into it, at least based on just a trailer or two. Asked in a recent interview with IndieWire how she feels about the weeks-long spoiler-guessing unfurling on social media, and the actress with succinct.

""It`s bloody annoying. Frustrating,"" Clarke said. ""It`s more complicated than people are guessing.""

And, yes, while the film does indeed pack a twist, Clarke believes it`s far more nuanced than people are expecting.

Written by Thompson (who also appears in the film as Clarke`s character`s mother) and first-time screenwriter Bryony Kimmings, the initial idea sprung from a concept developed by Thompson and her husband Greg Wise. And it`s one they spent some time refining.

""Emma and Greg wrote this script together, but they sent the script to all of their friends and it was only ready when their friends didn`t see the twist coming and couldn`t guess until it happens, so that`s where it comes from,"" Clarke said. ""It`s just frustrating.""

It`s hardly the first time Clarke has dealt with fans turning to social media to spout off about her projects. After the series finale of her popular HBO series ""Game of Thrones,"" displeased fans took to the internet to launch an online petition that urged series creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss to remake the final six episodes, many of which divided ""Thrones"" fans around the world.

The series` penultimate episode, ""The Bells,"" proved to be one of its most divisive, thanks to a twist in which Clarke`s Daenerys Targaryen went full Mad Queen and burned King`s Landing to the ground.

""I`m careful with what the way that I`m wording this, but it`s no surprise, it`s common knowledge that the state of our world at the moment is scared and confused and there`s a lot of stuff going on that`s completely out of our control,"" Clarke said. ""So when it comes to signing petitions to reshoot the last season of a very popular TV show, or whether it`s spoiling a goddamn Christmas rom-com, people are able to do something about that.""

As frustrating as it might be, Clarke is introspective about what`s really going on with our current spoiler culture.

""That`s something within their own control, unlike the rather turbulent political environment that we seem to be living in,"" she said. ""Our world`s literally on fire, so I think that there`s a lot of things outside of people`s control, so when it comes to this kind of stuff, they can do something with it and want to. It`s done with so much fervor, it`s done with a huge amount of energy and all that is, is misdirected energy.""

4446815,"NATO needs the F-35 to keep up with evolving threats from Russia, but in a decade, NATO will still only be flying 20% fifth-generation fighters — meaning 80% probably can`t fight against Russia on day one.

This puts NATO at a huge disadvantage against Russia, which has new, cheap, and deadly systems meant to shoot down NATO`s legacy aircraft by the hundreds.

The Royal Air Force’s Air-Vice Marshal Simon Rochelle has proposed plans to keep legacy aircraft fighting and supercharged with the information pulled from fifth-gen fighters and other support planes.

Rochelle warned that if NATO can`t fix its interoperability problems across its 28 members, it will lose the next war against Russia.

LONDON—Much of NATO’s hope to remain a relevant fighting force in the coming decades has been pinned on the introduction of the F-35, but a simple look at the numbers shows that one airframe alone won’t turn the tide against Russia.

“If we think we’re going to wait for the next generation to sort the problems out, I can categorically tell you we will fail when next major conflict occurs.” Royal Air Force’s Air-Vice Marshal Simon Rochelle told the Royal United Service Institute’s Combat Air Survivability conference on Wednesday.

""In 2030, 80% of the European NATO forces — should one of those situations occur, god forbid — will be gen 4 fighters. You can’t walk away from that,” he continued, referring to pre-stealth jets as belonging to a fourth generation of fighters.

While Rochelle sounded confident in the F-35’s ability to meet current and future threats, he stressed that NATO wouldn’t hit critical mass in its fifth generation fleets in time for the next big conflict.

But instead of demanding a deeper well of F-35s, Rochelle said the only practical way was to spread the benefits of the F-35 horizontally, to other airframes.

“I need the F-35’s ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) information off boarded,,” he said. ""We have F-35s and Typhoons, and I have to use those symbiotically. I can’t afford poor interoperability.""

Too little, too late

While the UK has its own fifth-gem fighter planned, the Tempest, Rochelle said the slow pace of fielding the fighters slightly defeated the purpose.

""If both those airframes take 10 years to mature to the next level, they won’t fit the purpose,"" he continued.

In the meantime, Russia has come up with a slew of new, low-cost and potentially potent weapons systems meant to down NATO jets.

""The threats, in terms of how it is progressing, [are] significant,"" said Rochelle of Russian systems like the S-400, which has begun to proliferate across the globe with China, Syria, and even NATO member Turkey looking to buy.

""Those systems are so complex and so capable that a price point for those systems of defense is far cheaper than the long running programs we have in the aircraft to development,"" said Rochelle. ""We can’t afford not to respond at pace, because our adversaries are responding at pace.""

An S-400 can spot even stealth aircraft like the F-35, and using a relatively cheap missile, down a jet that costs many hundred times its own value.

Additionally, Russia may have the even more advanced S-500 system online by the time fifth-generation fighter aircraft hit the front lines en masse.

""They are formidable beasts,"" Rochelle said of Russia`s new systems, which include directed energy weapons.

Think fast

At the Rapid Capabilities Office in the RAF, Rochelle`s job is to innovate new solutions to these mounting problems, and get them done fast.

Rochelle discussed cutting down extensive, sometimes grueling testing requirements for non-mission critical components of fighter aircraft, and how his office was able to get Tornado jets fighting ISIS in 191 days.

When it came to networking the F-35 into the bigger NATO fight against Russia, Rochelle was full of ideas.

""I want to be able to connect a Rivet Joint, through space, into the cockpit… we need to be thinking in those dimensions,"" he said, referencing the US and UK`s standard airborne signals intelligence plane which can help spot anti-air batteries like Russia`s S-400.

Read more: Russia could destroy the F-35 from within with a missile-defense sale to Turkey

""Ideally, I`d like to reprogram the F-35 in flight"" with new information, potentially including things spotted by Rivet Joints and other legacy aircraft.

Essentially, Rochelle knows that Europe won`t have B-21s, F-22s, and F-35s of its own on day one of a conflict with Russia, and has launched a series of programs to make his Typhoons fight harder with the benefit of targeting and threat data pulled from F-35s.

In effect, he`s gunning for a much cheaper, lighter air force that takes the cutting edge of the F-35 and spreads it out across the entire mass of NATO`s jet fighter fleet."
4003913,"Efforts by Russia and China to develop space technologies are challenging US dominance in the space race and threaten to cripple its galactic security supremacy, a new report by the Pentagon has warned.

Beijing and Moscow are eyeing up several different methods to undermine the United States in space, from ground-based anti-satellite missiles to orbital vessels loaded with lasers capable of destroying other spacecraft, said the report published on Monday.

""Some actors are seeking ways to deny the effectiveness of the United States, having witnessed more than 25 years of US military successes enabled by space capabilities,"" the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) study said.

""China and Russia, in particular, are developing a variety of means to exploit perceived US reliance on space-based systems and challenge the US position in space,"" it added, citing examples including jamming technology and directed energy weapons.

Describing both countries` space services as ""robust"", the DIA said Russia and China were able to use their apparatuses to ""monitor, track, and target US and allied forces"".

Outer space arms race

Responding to the report on Tuesday, China accused the DIA of making ""unwarranted and utterly baseless comments"".

""China upholds the peaceful use of outer space and opposes weaponising outer space or an arms race there,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a press conference in the capital, Beijing.

""For many years, China, Russia and other countries have been working hard and trying to reach an international legal instrument to fundamentally prevent the weaponisation of or an arms race in outer space,"" she added.

China, Russia and the US are all signatories to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits its members from stationing weapons of mass destruction in space and only permits use of the moon and other celestial bodies for peaceful purposes.

In 2008, China and Russia presented a proposal to ban the use of weapons in outer space under a new treaty. The US rejected the idea.

Trump pledges `space force`

While predominantly focused on Russia and China, the DIA`s report also claimed Iran and North Korea posed a challenge to the US` space-based systems, citing both countries` ""jamming capabilities"" and independent space launch facilities.

190118144725288

Its publication comes just weeks after US President Donald Trump announced that Washington would recognise space was a ""new war-fighting domain"", adding his proposed ""space force"" cosmic military branch would lead the way.

""My upcoming budget will invest in a space-based missile defence layer, it`s new technology and it`s ultimately going to be a very, very big part of our defence and, obviously, of our offence,"" Trump said last month.

In December, the US leader signed a memorandum of understanding ordering the Department of Defense to create a new organisational structure within the Pentagon charged with overall control of all military space operations.

Russia has warned Trump`s strategy could unleash a dangerous arms race in space."
2930840,"China and Russia are likely building high-powered lasers that can shoot down US satellites, according to a new Pentagon report.

Both countries are developing an arsenal of anti-satellite weaponry including missiles, cyber attacks, and ""directed energy weapons,"" according to the US Defense Intelligence Agency.

On Monday, the agency released an unclassified report on the security threat to the US`s dominance in space. It calls out both China and Russia as two countries with the technological prowess to take down US communication and navigational satellites, which could cause mayhem for businesses and the military.

The threat may sound far-fetched. But not to the Pentagon; the agency`s report lays out all the different ways Beijing and Moscow could attack US satellites in order to win future wars.

China, for instance, is attempting to become a ""space power"" that`s focused on exploration and defense, according to the DIA. The agency goes on to claim that the Chinese military is probably attempting to build a laser weapon system that can ""disrupt, degrade, or damage,"" orbital satellites and the sensors they use.

""China likely will field a ground-based laser weapon that can counter low-orbit space-based sensors by 2020, and by the mid-to-late 2020s, it may field higher-power systems that extend the threat to the structures of non-optical satellites,"" the report claims.

Russia is also pursuing satellite-killing lasers, according to the DIA. But the danger isn`t simply contained to energy-based attacks. China and Russia are developing satellites that can inspect and repair other satellites in space, which ""could also be used to approach another country`s satellite and conduct an attack that results in temporary or permanent damage,"" the DIA warns.

President Trump last year announced plans for a Space Force, a new branch of the US armed forces charged with developing next-generation aerospace military technology and ""space warfighting"" tactics.

Monday`s report doesn`t mention how the US might fend off these threats. But it`s no secret that we`ve long had an interest in laser weaponry as well. In recent years, the US military has been testing prototypes on Navy ships and for use on aircraft.

China was quick to dismiss the DIA`s report. ""What is alarming and concerning is that the US has defined the outer space as combat territory, announcing to build a space troop, frequently conducting outer space military drills,"" said a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to CNN.

Tuesday`s proposal is the latest move by the current administration to roll back environmental protections put in place by Trump`s predecessor, President Barack Obama.

Combined with the EPA`s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move could increase the country`s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia, a top coal-producing state, on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country`s power producers towards less-polluting energy from natural gas, wind and solar power, among others.

Meanwhile, Trump also directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut US carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

2361598,"General Electric (GE) is developing engine technology for the Air Force to enable an array of new weapons on a future 6th-generation fighter that would follow Lockheed Martin`s (LMT) 5th-generation jets, the F-22 and F-35.

X

For several years, both GE and United Technologies` (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit have been working with the Air Force Research Laboratory on adaptive cycle engines (ACE). Unlike the fixed-airflow engines powering today`s military aircraft, ACE promises to enable automatic switching between high-thrust mode for maximum power and high-efficiency mode for fuel savings, based on the pilot`s mission.

GE has been developing the ACE for an eventual upgrade to the F-35`s engines. Those are currently sourced solely from Pratt & Whitney. But the Air Force awarded a $437 million contract modification last month to GE for development work on an engine that powers a 6th-generation fighter.

""It will be a game changer in combat capability with unmatched improvements in range, thrust and heat dissipation capacity, critical to future mission requirements,"" said Dan McCormick, general manager of GE`s Advanced Combat Engine Program, in a statement.

He later told IBD in an interview that he expects ""design work to start very, very soon.""

Lasers On 6th-Generation Fighter — And More

In addition to improved thrust and fuel efficiency, a key innovation planned for the ACE is a third cooling stream that will absorb and dissipate more heat produced by a jet, including from its engine and onboard systems.

GE Aviation estimates that three-stream technology will deliver a 60% improvement in heat absorption, allowing aircraft to accommodate more next-gen weapons technology.

While plans for a 6th-generation fighter are still in the works, with Lockheed and Boeing (BA) each looking at early designs, it could have lasers, electronic warfare capabilities, hypersonic weapons and other futuristic features.

McCormick said GE`s ACE puts the 6th-generation fighter ""in a position"" to deploy laser weapons and ""to do it at long range.""

""But it goes well beyond the possibility of lasers,"" he added. ""There are now radar and defensive systems — it really enables any heat-generating equipment to be added to the aircraft.""

GE Rival Pratt & Whitney Sees F-35 Lasers

United Technologies` jet engine unit is developing a similar engine that will also support futuristic weapons.

In September 2017, Pratt & Whitney said its successful tests of an adaptive three-stream fan showed the engine architecture was suited for next-gen military combat aircraft.

It also is refining F-35 engine technology with more power and thermal management capability to allow use of ""directed energy weapons and other advanced offensive and defensive systems.""

6th-Generation Fighter: More Power, More Targets

GE`s technology is still at the prototype stage but it sees a 50% improvement in loiter time for its ACE, allowing pilots to ""persist"" longer in areas of interest and conduct increasingly vital stealth missions. It also sees a 35% increase in range and a 25% reduction in fuel consumption.

Combined, that efficient fuel burn and higher thrust will enable military aircraft to go greater distances and engage more targets, according to GE.

3544332,"Lockheed Martin Selected for NASA`s Commercial Lunar Lander Payload Services Contract

Only Company to Build Four Successful Mars Landers will Offer Commercial Lunar Payload Deliveries

DENVER, Nov. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will apply its expertise in interplanetary spacecraft to a new program designed to deliver commercial payloads to the surface of the Moon. NASA announced today they have selected Lockheed Martin`s McCandless Lunar Lander to provide payload delivery services as part of the agency`s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) contract.

Lockheed Martin`s lander design builds on four decades of experience engineering deep space missions, including Mars landers. The McCandless Lunar Lander is based on the proven design of the InSight lander – which just touched down on the Martian surface on Monday, Nov. 26 – and the Phoenix lander – which successfully arrived at Mars in May 2008.

""We are excited to leverage our interplanetary lander designs and experience to help NASA build a new economy on and around the Moon, and beyond,"" said Lisa Callahan, vice president and general manager for Commercial Civil Space at Lockheed Martin. ""Lockheed Martin has built more interplanetary spacecraft than all other U.S. companies combined, including four successful Mars landers. With our expertise on Orion and the NextSTEP lunar habitat, we can maximize the value of CLPS for lunar science operations as well as the path forward to tomorrow`s reusable human lander.""

The McCandless Lunar Lander is capable of transporting large payloads weighing hundreds of kilograms – including stationary scientific instruments, deployable rovers, or even sample return vehicles – to the surface of the Moon. The lander uses a proven propulsive landing approach that relies upon on-board radars and a set of rocket thrusters firing 10 times a second to slow to just five mph before touching down. Once on the lunar surface, the lander can provide power, communications and thermal management for sophisticated payloads.

""We`re no stranger to commercial space business models, having built more than 100 commercial satellites and launched numerous Atlas and Titan commercial payloads,"" said Callahan. ""On our last 10 interplanetary missions for NASA, we delivered on or ahead of schedule, and on budget. We want to assure payload customers who select Lockheed Martin can be confident that we`ll deliver on-time and on-budget.""

The McCandless Lunar Lander is named in honor of the late Bruce McCandless, a NASA astronaut and longtime Lockheed Martin employee who was a pioneer in space exploration. McCandless is best known for conducting the first ever untethered spacewalk using the Lockheed Martin-built Manned Maneuvering Unit during a flight on the space shuttle. He originally joined the astronaut corps during the Apollo program and served as the voice of mission control for Neil Armstrong`s famous moonwalk. After retiring from NASA he was instrumental in the design of exploration technology and training the next generation of planetary explorers during his tenure at Lockheed Martin.

179121,"DENVER (AP) — Scientists say they have more evidence that an increase in earthquakes on the Colorado-New Mexico border since 2001 has been caused by wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground, similar to human-caused quakes in Oklahoma and other states.

A paper published last week by researchers at the University of Colorado concluded that the wastewater caused a big enough increase in underground pressure to make rock formations slip along fault lines.

""You find that the pressures at any given depth are enough to trigger earthquakes,"" said Jenny Nakai, the paper`s lead author and a doctoral student at the university.

The paper, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, is the latest to link wastewater injection wells to earthquakes.

Most oil and gas wells produce at least some wastewater that is too salty to use, so regulators allow energy companies to pump it back underground to get rid of it. Researchers have linked earthquakes in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas to wastewater injection.

Oklahoma had only a few dozen earthquakes of magnitude-3.0 or greater in 2012 but had more than 900 in 2015. The number dropped to closer to 600 last year after state regulators directed energy companies to close some injection wells or reduce the volume of water they inject.

In the Raton Basin of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, earthquakes began to increase in 2001, about two years after large-scale wastewater injection began, the U.S. Geological Service said. The wastewater comes from wells that extract natural gas from underground coal beds.

The biggest quake in the basin since 2001 was magnitude-5.3 in 2011. It caused minor damage to buildings in Trinidad, Colorado, about 15 miles from the epicenter.

A 2014 paper by the Geological Service blamed injection wells for the area`s quakes. The new University of Colorado study went further, using computer models and records of wastewater injection to conclude that enough pressure built up to cause the quakes.

Justin Rubinstein, a geophysicist with the Geological Service who was the lead author of the 2014 paper, said the computer models have been used in other locations but not in the Raton Basin before now.

This June, 2014, photo provided by the University of Colorado shows graduate student Jenny Nakai looking at data from seismographs in Weld County in northern Colorado. Nakai is the lead author of a study that found more evidence linking earthquakes in another area on the Colorado-New Mexico border to wells that inject wastewater from oil and gas production back underground. (Anne Sheehan/University of Coloradovia AP)

Rubinstein was not involved in the University of Colorado study and said he was not familiar with all its details but that the general conclusions made sense.

""It`s consistent with what my research has shown,"" he said.

The University of Colorado study also found that the Raton Basin earthquakes were more widespread than previously thought, said Nakai, the lead author.

Earlier studies focused on the Colorado portion of the basin because that was the site of a 2001 swarm of 12 quakes — the strongest was magnitude-4.6 — as well as the 5.3 quake in 2011.

But seismometers recorded 1,881 quakes in the area between 2008 and 2010, and 1,442 of them were in New Mexico, Nakai said. The strongest was magnitude-3.8.

The 2008-2010 data came from a temporary deployment of seismometers as part of two other research projects funded by the National Science Foundation, Nakai said.

1095987,"The U.S. military wants a laser gun. It really, really wants one.

Soon it may get not one -- but two.

Last month, we told you about the U.S. Navy`s effort to develop a ""Ground Based Air Defense Directed Energy On-the-Move Future Naval Capabilities"" laser gun. Even in acronym form, that`s quite a mouthful. But what it boils down to is the Navy wanting to build a prototype 25-kilowatt laser cannon, mount it on a Humvee, and see if the thing could shoot down some low-flying aircraft and drones.

The Pentagon hired Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) to take on the task, with the latter promising to get a ""Marine Humvee-based high energy laser"" ready for testing ""in the very near future."" Just a couple weeks ago, however, we learned that Raytheon rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) may have a similar weapons system already in hand.

Crossing the streams: Boeing versus Raytheon

At just 10 kilowatts in power, Boeing`s laser, mercifully dubbed just the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator, or HEL MD, is less powerful than the laser cannon that Raytheon hopes to build. It`s of similar size, though. If Raytheon`s stated goal is to build a laser cannon so small you can fit it in the back of a Humvee, Boeing`s HEL MD easily fit aboard a not-much-bigger Oshkosh tactical military vehicle.

The tasks the two companies see their laser guns as able to execute are similar. Raytheon has been hired to build a ""high power,"" ""light-weight,"" and ""rugged"" laser weapon capable of shooting down low-flying hostile aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (""drones"") for the Marine Corps. Boeing`s version is designed more as a ""C-RAM"" system -- ""counter rocket, artillery and mortar"" -- to shoot down missiles being fired at U.S. troops.

But during tests at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, Boeing`s laser successfully acquired, tracked, and engaged not only 60 mm mortar rounds in flight, but drones as well.

Maintaining momentum

The Eglin tests suggest Boeing is already a good step ahead of Raytheon in developing a working laser cannon, small enough to be transported aboard a small armored car. And Boeing seems intent on maintaining its lead. According to a company press release, Boeing`s next step will be to increase power levels on its laser to 50 or even 60 kilowatts, to further demonstrate HEL MD`s efficacy in shooting down aerial threats.

The question investors need to ask themselves now is: How big of a lead does Boeing have in the race to build workable laser weapons for U.S. ground forces? Weapons powerful enough to shoot down incoming tactical missiles, yet also small enough, light enough, and rugged enough to be transportable to the places those missiles are aiming at?

The answer could be as big as ""five years."" We first wrote about Boeing`s efforts to build high-energy laser weapons for U.S. ground forces back in 2009. (Boeing`s work on laser weapons for other branches of the military, such as the abandoned Airborne Laser built for the U.S. Air Force, stretch back even further). In contrast, Raytheon`s involvement in laser work has been more limited. Last month`s contract with the Navy, for example, was for only $11 million, which suggests Raytheon is still in the early innings in this game.

The upshot for investors

The Pentagon is very interested in developing laser weapons systems for U.S. military forces -- and no wonder. According to Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder, the Laser Weapon Systems, or LaWS, that the Navy is building will cost ""about one dollar to shoot."" Assuming mobile high-energy lasers for ground forces are similarly cost effective, there`s a real financial incentive to developing this technology.

Who will ultimately perfect the devices remains to be seen. Boeing`s multiple contract wins in the field of laser tech suggest that the world`s biggest plane-maker is also the leading light in laser tech. But Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin -- all the big names in defense contracting, really -- are making at least some efforts in this direction. Indeed, even tiny Kratos Defense & Security (NASDAQ:KTOS) has a stake. Kratos is named as the builder of the Navy`s LaWS system.

Investors should take a cue from industry`s intense focus on laser technology, and the potential for contract wins -- and profits -- that it may foreshadow. After all, where there`s smoke, there`s often fire -- and one day soon, maybe a laser beam starting that fire."
1136057,"UPDATED w/ Sen. McCain’s “optimism,” Cdr. Clark’s analysis WASHINGTON: At 1:10 pm today, the Navy issued its official wishlist for its future frigate and set a 45-day deadline for shipbuilders to respond. As acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley had promised, today’s Request For Information (RFI) opens the door wide to both US and foreign designs. It doesn’t lock the Navy into buying an upgraded variant of the current Littoral Combat Ships, but it doesn’t rule that out, either.

Overall, the performance requirements in the RFI suggest a very different vessel than the original LCS, one capable not only of auxiliary duties but of escorting aircraft carriers and supply convoys in conjunction with Aegis destroyers. A few parameters in particular stand out:

Reliability: The future frigate should be fully functional (“operational availability”) at least 72 percent of the time. Both the single-hulled Freedom and trimaran Independence LCS have suffered embarrassing breakdowns, beyond the normal teething troubles of a new class.

The future frigate should be fully functional (“operational availability”) at least 72 percent of the time. Both the single-hulled Freedom and trimaran Independence LCS have suffered embarrassing breakdowns, beyond the normal teething troubles of a new class. Survivability: The frigate’s propulsion, weapons, and other “critical systems” should be sufficiently well-protected (“shock hardening”) for the ship to take a hit and keep fighting, at least with its defensive anti-aircraft systems. The original concept for LCS was to retreat for repairs once hit, so critical systems on LCS are not shock-hardened and were tested less rigorously than the Navy norm, according to the Pentagon’s independent Director of Operational Test & Evaluation.

Crew Size: The frigate may have up to 200 crew. By contrast, reducing crew size — and therefore personnel costs — was a major driver of the original LCS design. The small crew raised concerns about having insufficient manpower for routine maintenance, let alone damage control in battle. Even after increasing the crew, LCS still deploys with about 70 sailors.

The small crew raised concerns about having insufficient manpower for routine maintenance, let alone damage control in battle. Even after increasing the crew, LCS still deploys with about 70 sailors. Speed: The frigate must reach and sustain speeds of at least 28 knots (32 mph) . That’s fast enough to keep up with a carrier battle group, but it’s slow compared to the LCS, which can sprint at over 40 knots. That top speed required enormous, expensive, and complex engines relative to the size of the ship, as well as exotically streamlined hulls, driving the whole design, but the Navy never found a solid tactical reason for going that fast.

In short, the Navy wants the frigate to do certain things better than the LCS — and the things the LCS does well, the Navy doesn’t care much about.

Then there’s the loaded question of weapons. The Navy had already committed to installing a long-range Over The Horizon (OTH) anti-ship missile on both the future frigates and, through retrofits, to the existing LCS. It had ruled out the major modifications to the ship required to install Vertical Launch Systems — essentially, missile silos built into the hull — although both LCS manufacturers said they could add VLS to their designs if asked. The new Request For Information asks for a minimum of eight OTH missiles, but then it raises an intriguing possibility of heavier armament that would require a VLS.

First, the RFI says “the Navy is particularly interested” in defensive weapons, specifically naming the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) and the SM-2 Standard Missile. While the ESSM can be launched from rails mounted on deck, the SM-2 is almost always fired from a Vertical Launch System. (The Navy briefly used rail launchers for SM-2s, but they were all retired in favor of VLS).

Then, the Navy indicates further interest in “strike length variants to maximize weapons flexibility” — i.e. launch systems capable of handling offensive weapons as well as defensive ones — “if able to be cost effectively integrated.” While very cautious and cost-constrained, this language suggests a strong interest in the dual-purpose offensive/defensive Vertical Launch System.

Another intriguing detail is the instruction that all designs must reserve 26 tons of weight and 600 kilowatts of electrical power “for future Directed Energy and Active EA.” EA means electronic attack, i.e. jamming enemy radios and radars, a vital military specialty in which the US has lost ground compared to Russia and China. “Directed energy” means high-powered microwaves and lasers. The Navy has been keenly interested in defensive lasers, putting one on the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf to shoot down drones — but that’s only a 30-kilowatt weapon: the future frigate could fire a far more powerful laser.

It’s important to remember that the Navy is still exploring the art of the possible here, and is not yet building a ship. The Request For Information (RFI) is just that, asking companies to provide their existing ship designs, estimated costs to modify them to Navy requirements, and rough costs and schedules to build the first ship in 2020 and two more a year thereafter.

This is not the official beginning of a competition — that would be the Request For Proposals, RFP — nor a binding commitment on the Navy’s part. But with those caveats, the Request For Information gives a fascinating window into what the Navy wants.

UPDATED LCS arch-critic John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced Wednesday that he was “cautiously optimistic” about the Navy’s direction. “I am cautiously optimistic regarding the request for information on a new Frigate program that the Navy released yesterday,” McCain said in a statement. “This new Frigate must be more capable than the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, with minor modifications. For example, the new Frigate’s ability to perform local area air defense for convoys of ships would provide a necessary and clear capability improvement over the LCS program.”

Meanwhile, retired Navy Commander Bryan Clark, a former top aide to the Chief of Naval Operations, gave us his analysis of the requirements — putting particular emphasis on places where the Navy seems willing to accept less powerful, more affordable frigate:

“The RFI implies the Navy is still concerned about the cost of the new ship and perhaps wants to use the FFG(X) as something other than a traditional frigate,” Clark wrote in an email. “This RFI incorporates several optional requirements that would reduce the FFG(X)’s capability and cost. For example:

“The FFG(X) is not required to do air defense for another ship. (It) would conduct ASW (anti-submarine warfare) and ASUW (anti-surface warfare) and have improved survivability against air threats. The RFI leaves open the degree to which the FFG(X) would be able to do air defense for another ship, asking respondents to propose how they would provide for air defense, and what launchers, such as VLS, they would use to host ESSM and SM-2 interceptors. ESSM would provide the bare minimum capability needed to defend another ship, but only in very constrained geometries where the FFG(X) is very close to the defended ship and between the defended ship and an incoming missile. In other situations, an SM-2 would probably be required.”

The Navy is leaving its options open here, Clark said, because it’s leery of installing heavy-duty air defense would increase cost and degrade performance, potentially to the point it knocks LCS-derived designs out of the running. “While Congress is pushing foreign designs such as the Fincantieri FREMM or Navantia F-105 (which already have VLS installed), the Navy likely wants variants of the current LCS to be able to compete for FFG(X),” he said. “To include VLS, the Freedom-class LCS would likely need a hull extension; the Austal LCS may be heavier with VLS and become slower and less efficient.”

Similarly, Clark notes, the RFI only requires passive, defensive electronic warfare systems, not active jamming capability, and it puts anti-submarine warfare at a lower priority (“Tier 2”) than either defensive systems or offensive anti-ship weapons. “While the RFI says the Navy wants a ship capable of doing (both) ASUW and ASW,” he said, “this could result in an option for FFG(X) that is less expensive and focused on ASUW.”

Overall, Clark said, these requirements suggest less a traditional frigate than a kind of picket ship, a spotter transmitting targeting data to more powerful vessels: “Instead of being a full-up multi-mission frigate, the RFI suggests the FFG(X)’s job is to support Distributed Maritime Operations and Distributed Lethality by hosting unmanned systems and acting as a remote active and passive sensor to support shooters over the horizon” — such as the more powerful Aegis destroyers."
1153816,"The Office of Naval Research’s much-hyped electromagnetic railgun prototype is finally capable of flexing its futuristic muscles.

After more than a decade of research and development and more than more than $500 million it will likely never see combat.

The electromagnetic railgun could land in a “valley of death” between R&D and procurement.



It can fire a solid metal slug at speeds of up to 4,500 mph, or Mach 6. It can hit targets up to 100 nautical miles away. It’s capable of defeating incoming ballistic missiles and liquefying even the most durable enemy armor, the equivalent of a weaponized meteor strike fired from the world’s most powerful gun.

After more than a decade of research and development and more than more than $500 million, the Office of Naval Research’s much-hyped electromagnetic railgun prototype is finally capable of flexing its futuristic muscles — but despite the swirl of science-fiction excitement surrounding the muscular new cannon, it will likely never see combat, Task & Purpose has learned.



According to interviews with several congressional and military sources, the much-hyped supergun has come under scrutiny from lawmakers and military planners thanks to the Strategic Capabilities Office, the once-classified department created in 2012 to fast-track new tech languishing in the DoD’s sprawling bureaucracy, and develop, as then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter once put it, “game-changing capabilities to confound potential enemies.”

With SCO’s interest drawn to other weapons systems, ONR may end up without the necessary funding to push the exceedingly complex railgun toward a critical testing milestone — a delay that, with increasing budget pressures and the DoD’s shifting strategic priorities, could condemn the decade-long project to an inescapable limbo of research and tinkering far from any ship.

‘They’re simply not buying it’

Over the last decade, the Pentagon has funneled money into the development of several next-generation, directed-energy weapons through the Navy’s Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations: The electromagnetic railgun, which has been in development since 2005 in conjunction with defense contractors General Atomics and BAE Systems; the hypervelocity projectile (HVP), a super dense, low-drag tungsten projectile designed as specialized ammo for the railgun; and solid-state lasers, long-time fixations of every service branch and a near-term short-range missile defense for surface vessels.

As of a Nov. 30 Congressional Research Service update , electromagnetic railgun research was progressing in line with the ONR roadmap that once envisioned installing the co mpleted weapon on a destroyer like the USS Zumwalt by the mid-2020s.

In recent years, however, SCO has turned its attention to the HVP: once developed explicitly for the railgun, the super-dense shell’s compatibility with conventional powder artillery, offering a cheaper and less technically complex alternative to the Pentagon’s incomplete supergun for not just the Navy, but the Army to rapidly equip.

“SCO shifted the project’s focus to conventional powder guns, facilitating a faster transition of HVP technology to the warfighter,” SCO spokesman Chris Sherwood told Task & Purpose.

“Our priority continues to be the HVP, which is reflected in the program’s budget.”

Researchers and policymakers confident on the system’s potential now fear that the reallocation of railgun funding at SCO’s behest will end up forestalling the successful installation and demonstration of a tactical rig aboard a naval vessel.

According to multiple legislative and military sources, insufficient funding for the railgun in the current defense budget will grind any meaningful progress to a halt, condemning efforts to R&D purgatory.

As one defense contractor with direct knowledge of the project recently told Task & Purpose, underfunding railgun now would effectively render the decade-long supergun project “dead in the water” by 2019.

“People at SCO don’t want to fund the railgun because they’re simply not buying it,” one senior legislative official with direct knowledge of the project told Task & Purpose. “They are imparting that priority on to Big Navy, which is pulling the money away from ONR.”

One last push

In the year since publishing the jaw-dropping footage of a tactical electromagnetic railgun demonstrator at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division’s Terminal Range in Virginia in November 2016, ONR has been working diligently alongside defense contractors BAE System and General Atomics to bring the supergun closer to combat readiness.

A second video released in July showed the rig firing off multi-shot salvos on Dahlgren’s 25-mile Potomac River test range. Through massive, repeated pulses of energy over a short period with minimal cooldown time, the railgun managed to fire 4.8 shells a minute, inching closer to the requirements laid out by Naval Sea Systems Command in a 2013 call for demonstrators that could fire 10 shells a minute and store up to 650 shells.



While ONR’s rep-rate demonstrations at Dahlgren represent a major leap forward for the railgun, the system still faces major technical hurdles that make the HVP a relatively inexpensive alternative.

Generating the electromagnetic fields necessary to accelerate a shell to tank-liquefying velocities without chemical propellants requires an energy farm or capacitor base significantly larger than what most Navy surface vessels can generate currently.

Next-generation “ electric warships ” like the Zumwalt can channel 78 megawatts from their generators through its power-distribution network, making them ideal for all manner of directed-energy weapons, but other surface vessels would require a major overhaul of their electrical infrastructure for the “pulsed-power architecture” required for multi-shot salvos.

The crucial railgun component that may threaten the entire effort is the “common mount.” A universal system for equipping sea or land-based platforms with a mass-produced tactical electromagnetic railgun, a 2016 House Armed Services Committee report noted that lawmakers were increasingly worried that SCO’s newfound HVP fetish “[had] left the Navy with a funding gap in developing the requirements and design for a common mount, which is a necessary prerequisite to getting this capability into operational use.” No mount, no tactical demonstrations — and, in turn, no railgun.

Without actually mounting a working demonstrator on a surface vessel, sources say, the electromagnetic railgun could land in a “valley of death” between R&D and procurement that may prevent the ambitious, decade-long project from ever going to war.

As with most technological moonshots, success and failure are a matter of optics: If the ONR can’t show off something with a Tony Stark-level “wow” factor for the military planners and lawmakers who pull ONR’s purse strings, researchers risk letter their political capital on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon E-ring slip away.

“Promising technologies fall into the ‘valley of death’ all the time,” a legislative source told Task & Purpose. “Testing is great, but unless you want to put money into transitioning that tech into an actual weapons system then what the hell are you doing? We’re afraid to take a risk and try to get things moving.”

The railgun’s advocates know the supergun is in trouble. In July, Rep. Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and co-chair of the Congressional Directed Energy Caucus, recommended an additional $26.4 million SCO outlays in the House Armed Service Committee’s version of the 2018 defense budget explicitly earmarked as “transition funding” for a shipboard tactical railgun demonstrator program, the second legislative boost to the project alongside an additional $15 million added to the Innovative Naval Prototypes line item by the Senate, according to an amendment justification obtained by Task & Purpose.

According to the Navy’s 2017 strategic program guide, the bulk of the appropriations already designated under that item line are for developing the thermal-management techniques that both the launcher and pulsed-power architecture require for that target sustained firing rate of 10 shells a minute.

The three-month continuing resolution passed in September offered a brief reprieve for advocates to make the case for an additional millions in transition funding to achieve a successful shipboard demonstration, and as of late November, lawmakers had authorized just $15 million of Langevin’s $26 million railgun amendment, funding the congressman told Task & Purpose would likely boost R&D efforts on the common mount.

“Our Navy must be given the ability to test this weapon’s lethality, range, and power at scale, and it must continue to develop the common mount prototype to take this technology to the next level for a shipboard demonstration,” Langevin told Task & Purpose.

But even though the NDAA is now in President Trump’s hands, the coming appropriations fight looming represents yet another uphill battle for the railgun program, putting ONR researchers who have devoted a decade to the project “in a constant state of stress,” as one legislative source put it.

“We’ll take it,” they told Task & Purpose of the $15 million approved by Congress, “but nobody has any idea what will happen after Dec. 8.”

Changing priorities

Despite the pleas of devoted researchers and congressional allies, the electromagnetic railgun will live and die at the whims of high-level decision-makers at the Department of Defense.

According to legislative and military sources, the legislative uncertainty and ONR’s resulting year-long charm offensive surrounding the supergun are shaped by changing strategic priorities within SCO, which wields considerable clout when it comes to developing next-generation weapons systems.

In 2015, SCO realized that the HVP, originally conceived as a specialized shell of the railgun, was just as effective when fired from a conventional powder cannons like the Army’s 105mm and 155mm M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers and the Navy’s deck-mounted Mk 45 5-inch guns.

A May 2016 report from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment found that large caliber guns could fire an HVP between 10 and 30 nautical miles at Mach 3, faster than conventional unguided rounds.

“We thought railguns were something we were really going to go after,” then-Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work stated at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C. in May 2016. “But it turns out that powder guns firing the same hypervelocity projectiles gets you almost as much as you would get out of the electromagnetic rail gun, but it’s something we can do much faster.”

The potential for rapid fielding across both the Army and Navy proved an alluring prospect for SCO’s mission, one that trumped the railgun’s hype.

When asked about the organization’s priorities, SCO spokesman Chris Sherwood confirmed to Task & Purpose that the office is focused on “developing the [HVP] for use in existing powder gun systems to give the Navy and Army near-term, cost-effective long-range fires and missile defense solutions.” Translation: Why invest in an expensive gun if the bullet alone can get the job done?

SCO has publically emphasize that it’s not abandoning the electromagnetic railgun outright. SCO chief William Roper insisted during a July 2016 conference that months after Work’s dismissal of the railgun, the new focus on the HVP would not jeopardize ONR’s work on the fearsome cannon.

“[It’s] not that we’re not interested in railgun — we are,” he said. “But if you look at the delta between fielding in quantity — we have [more than] a 1,000 powder guns, we have very few railguns.”

But according to military and legislative sources, SCO already squandered a shot at helping ONR achieve its critical shipboard installation milestone. In the internal justification memo obtained by Task & Purpose, Rep. Langevin’s office attributed the cut to transition funding under the 2017 defense budget to SCO, “[the] initial entity responsible for work done on the railgun mount, which they subsequently never undertook, leaving the responsibility to the Navy.”

Budget crunch

The problem of transition funding facing the electromagnetic railgun isn’t totally unique. Congressional budget anxieties frequently kill ambitious weapons development projects; consider the 7.62mm Interim Combat Service Rifle, the extra-lethal combat rifle solicited by the Army to defeat enemy body armor that ended up dead on the vine .

As one congressional source put it, “the greater question of uncertainty is: Just how much priority will the Navy and DoD give on the railgun in the coming years?”

An analysis of the Navy’s 2018 RDT&E funding request by Task & Purpose reveals significant changes in the line items that govern directed-energy systems. Appropriations for Power Projection Applied Research fell from $88.94 million in FY 2016 to $13.6 million in FY 2018 due to a reallocation of funding from railgun barrel testing; similarly, appropriation for Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development fell from $251.17 million in FY 2016 to $205.6 million, although this was partially due to the ramp-down of additional HVP research & development under that specific line item.

This isn’t to say the railgun is now completely without funding — Congress appears poised to fund a new Innovative Naval Prototypes line item to the tune of $163.1 million for a demonstrator, but the shifting funds reflect the SCO’s desire to separate the HVP from ONR’s existing suite of directed-energy programs.

“Money is being put into HVP, and not railgun projects, which is why the two are being split,” as one senior legislative official told Task & Purpose. “We’ve been able to rescue some of this funding, but Big Navy sees different opportunities, and because [the railgun] is a major challenge, they don’t want to explore it.”

As far as the Navy is concerned, the focus has remained on the core of the railgun project: the pure science and research that could, in time, put the futuristic weapons of tomorrow within the Pentagon’s grasp.



“ONR’s intention is to continue working on the system, continuing to maturing the components, and moving towards demonstrating a full-scale 32 megajoule launcher and pulsed power system capable of high repetition firing,” ONR spokesman David Smalley told Task & Purpose, declining to comment on funding decisions. “The S&T has continued to make great technical progress and there have been no show stoppers to date to prevent the Navy from having a railgun in the future.”"

As investigators conduct a painstaking probe for the causes of California’s devastating wildfires, conspiracists have spawned their own theory: ignition by a secret cabal of nefarious “internationalists,” including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sergey Brin, who seek to run the world.

“There are hidden powers behind these calculated strikes in California,” warns one YouTube video, titled “An Open Letter To the People of California.”

In Facebook forums, YouTube videos and Reddit threads amassing tens of thousands of views, believers swap manipulated images of “light pillars” from the sky — proof, they say, that rural homes were targeted to burn, forcing residents into cities, where they can be more easily controlled by shadowy forces scheming at oppression.

Jeff Durham/Bay Area News Group

People have long reached for far-flung theories to explain shocking calamities, such as the mysterious “grassy knoll” assassin of President John F. Kennedy and the U.S. government’s complicity in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.

Psychologists say these theories gain traction during times of trauma because they ease uncertainty, provide a platform for personal grievances and focus blame on an outside group — usually a network of “elites.” Suspicions are cradled by the internet, which allows people who share those thoughts to more easily connect.

“Whether it’s wildfires, contamination of water supply or some ‘deep state’ takeover — all these beliefs satisfy the need to make sense of a threatening and anxious world,” said psychologist Joseph A. Vitriol, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University.

There’s a new high-tech twist to the perceived plots behind California’s recent Paradise, Woolsey and Wine Country fires. Asserting that nature could never incite a fire so fast or hot, some conspiracists say images of the light pillars reveal “directed energy weaponry” that emits highly focused heat. Others say fires were ignited by drones or satellite-based lasers.

While believers are split over the precise contours of the conspiracy, they agree that “geoengineering” is behind California’s parched and flammable landscape. The state’s weather is being deliberately altered, they allege. Then aircraft dump “chemtrails” of drying agents, which are easily ignited.

Who’s behind this complex scheme? Conspiracy websites such as Infowars, run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones, claim it is a secret plot by the moneyed elite to make certain parts of the country off-limits to human use and impose control.

Widely shared maps titled “Wildfires line up EXACTLY in the same path as the California High Speed Rail System” offer evidence, the conspiracists claim, that the fires are a plot to move people out of the way for construction of the transit system, key to eventual state takeover.

(The made-up fire maps’ geography is off, showing that San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento were consumed by flames. Nor does the map line up with the train’s proposed route.)

Critics say social media companies have not stopped conspiracy theories from blossoming on their platforms. YouTube says it is committed to tackling misinformation, Facebook removed accounts that engage in “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” and Reddit banned a subreddit devoted to conspiracy theories, but sites continue to host false narratives about the fires in California.

Meanwhile, teams of highly skilled Cal Fire investigators are scouring the rugged terrain of Butte and Los Angeles counties for scientific clues to the fires — evidence that could someday aid prevention. The truth is climate change and poor forest management set the stage for these disasters, say scientists.

But that hasn’t stopped the theorists.

Former Petaluma fire Captain John Lord, who now lives in Lakeport, called the fires an “unnatural phenomenon.”

“The rate of spread is abnormally fast. … In a normal structural fire, there will always be things that are left — porcelain toilets, tiles, washers and dryers. In these fires, everything is gone,” he said.

“Planes released nanoparticles of metals, such as aluminum, into the atmosphere,” he said. “That is a drying agent, and highly combustible.”

On YouTube, a Paradise resident identified only as Cheryl described seeing “a huge corporate helicopter circling over my house … surveying the town, getting ready to grasp it.”

“The abundance of photographic and video evidence of so-called fire damage to both vehicles and structures in clear and conclusive. These November 2018 wildfires were not responsible for some ofthe most catastrophic destruction,” wrote Michael Thomas, editor of State of the Nation: Alternative News, Analysis and Commentary.

To be sure, some conspiracies turned out to be real. Watergate happened. So did the Iran-Contra affair. Unbelievably, the Russian government meddled in our 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But the creatively conspiratorial, if crazy, theories hold special appeal because fires can be mysterious, said psychology professor David Ludden of Georgia Gwinnett College, who studies conspiracies.

Camp Fire: Number of missing falls to 49 “And they fit in with an existing world view that we can’t trust the government, that all these nefarious agencies are out there trying to get us,” he said. Internet sharing “creates a sense of security and superiority, of having inside knowledge that others don’t.”

Such thinking can distract the public from learning the objective reality of wildfires, making it more difficult to reduce risk, said Harvard’s Vitriol.

“It’s not just your crazy uncle in a tin foil hat, ruminating about the government,” he said. If the internet gives these ideas traction, “they spread and gain legitimacy, so they’re harder to combat.”"
4452282,"LONDON — Much of NATO`s hope to remain a relevant fighting force in the coming decades has been pinned on the introduction of the F-35, but a simple look at the numbers shows that one airframe alone won`t turn the tide against Russia.

""If we think we`re going to wait for the next generation to sort the problems out, I can categorically tell you we will fail when next major conflict occurs."" Simon Rochelle, the Royal Air Force`s air vice-marshal, told the Royal United Service Institute`s Combat Air Survivability conference on Wednesday.

""In 2030, 80% of the European NATO forces — should one of those situations occur, God forbid — will be gen 4 fighters. You can`t walk away from that,"" he continued, referring to pre-stealth jets as belonging to a fourth generation of fighters.

While Rochelle sounded confident in the F-35`s ability to meet current and future threats, he stressed that NATO wouldn`t hit critical mass in its fifth-generation fleets in time for the next big conflict.

But instead of demanding a deeper well of F-35s, Rochelle said the only practical way was to spread the benefits of the F-35 horizontally, to other airframes.

""I need the F-35`s ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) information off boarded,"" he said. ""We have F-35s and Typhoons, and I have to use those symbiotically. I can`t afford poor interoperability.""

Too little, too late

While the UK has its own fifth-gen fighter planned, the Tempest, Rochelle said the slow pace of fielding the fighters slightly defeated the purpose.

""If both those airframes take 10 years to mature to the next level, they won`t fit the purpose,"" he said.

In the meantime, Russia has come up with a slew of new, low-cost, and potentially potent weapons systems meant to down NATO jets.

""The threats, in terms of how it is progressing, [are] significant,"" Rochelle said of Russian systems such as the S-400, which has begun to proliferate across the globe with China, Syria, and even the NATO member Turkey looking to buy.

""Those systems are so complex and so capable that a price point for those systems of defense is far cheaper than the long running programs we have in the aircraft to development,"" Rochelle said. ""We can`t afford not to respond at pace, because our adversaries are responding at pace.""

An S-400 can spot even stealth aircraft such as the F-35 and, using a relatively cheap missile, down a jet that costs many hundred times its own value.

Additionally, Russia may have the even more advanced S-500 system online by the time fifth-generation fighter aircraft hit the front lines en masse.

""They are formidable beasts,"" Rochelle said of Russia`s new systems, which include directed energy weapons.

Think fast

At the Rapid Capabilities Office in the Royal Air Force, Rochelle`s job is to innovate new solutions to these mounting problems and get them done fast.

Rochelle discussed cutting down extensive, sometimes grueling testing requirements for non-mission critical components of fighter aircraft. He also explained how his office was able to get Tornado jets fighting ISIS in 191 days.

When it came to fitting the F-35 into the bigger NATO fight against Russia, Rochelle was full of ideas.

""I want to be able to connect a Rivet Joint, through space, into the cockpit … We need to be thinking in those dimensions,"" he said, referencing the US and UK`s standard airborne signals-intelligence plane that can help spot anti-air batteries like Russia`s S-400.

Read more: Russia could destroy the F-35 from within with a missile-defense sale to Turkey

""Ideally, I`d like to reprogram the F-35 in flight"" with new information, potentially including things spotted by Rivet Joints and other legacy aircraft.

Essentially, Rochelle knows that Europe won`t have B-21s, F-22s, and F-35s of its own on day one of a conflict with Russia, and has launched a series of programs to make his Typhoons fight harder with the benefit of targeting and with threat data pulled from F-35s.

In effect, he`s gunning for a much cheaper, lighter air force that takes the cutting edge of the F-35 and spreads it out across the entire mass of NATO`s jet fighter fleet."
4242867,"Efforts by Russia and China to develop space technologies are challenging US dominance in the space race and threaten to cripple its galactic security supremacy, a new report by the Pentagon has warned.

Beijing and Moscow are eyeing up several different methods to undermine the United States in space, from ground-based anti-satellite missiles to orbital vessels loaded with lasers capable of destroying other spacecraft, said the report published on Monday.

""Some actors are seeking ways to deny the effectiveness of the United States, having witnessed more than 25 years of US military successes enabled by space capabilities,"" the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) study said.

""China and Russia, in particular, are developing a variety of means to exploit perceived US reliance on space-based systems and challenge the US position in space,"" it added, citing examples including jamming technology and directed energy weapons.

Describing both countries` space services as ""robust"", the DIA said Russia and China were able to use their apparatuses to ""monitor, track, and target US and allied forces"".

Outer space arms race

Responding to the report on Tuesday, China accused the DIA of making ""unwarranted and utterly baseless comments"".

""China upholds the peaceful use of outer space and opposes weaponising outer space or an arms race there,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a press conference in the capital, Beijing.

""For many years, China, Russia and other countries have been working hard and trying to reach an international legal instrument to fundamentally prevent the weaponisation of or an arms race in outer space,"" she added.

China, Russia and the US are all signatories to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which prohibits its members from stationing weapons of mass destruction in space and only permits use of the moon and other celestial bodies for peaceful purposes.

In 2008, China and Russia presented a proposal to ban the use of weapons in outer space under a new treaty. The US rejected the idea.

Trump pledges `space force`

While predominantly focused on Russia and China, the DIA`s report also claimed Iran and North Korea posed a challenge to the US` space-based systems, citing both countries` ""jamming capabilities"" and independent space launch facilities.

""My upcoming budget will invest in a space-based missile defence layer, it`s new technology and it`s ultimately going to be a very, very big part of our defence and, obviously, of our offence,"" Trump said last month.

Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov offered a bit more information in an interview with Russian state media outlet TASS, explaining that the device could destroy targets ""within fractions of a second.""

""We can talk a lot about laser weapons and movies were made about them a long time ago and fantastic books have been written, and everyone knows about this,"" he introduced. ""But, the fact that these systems have started entering service is indeed a today’s reality.""

The Russian defense ministry posted a video of the weapon back in July, before it had officially entered service.

Not much is publicly known about the Peresvet combat laser system, as Sputnik, a Russian media outlet controlled by the government, noted. What exactly it does has been the subject of much speculation.

""It is expected to be an air-defense system that can track and shoot down hostile aircraft and missiles,"" Sputnik explained, adding, ""Some suggest it will be tasked with `blinding` sophisticated enemy systems, making them inoperable.""

Other countries, like the US and China, are also developing directed energy platforms.

China unveiled the LW-30, a vehicle-based laser weapon built to quickly eliminate a variety of aerial targets, at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai last month.

Experts speculated that the weapon designed by China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) could be deployed to the South China Sea."
3454587,"Recent Army artillery testing could give the fires community its first-ever ability to airlift self-propelled artillery in both small and large packages.

One piece of gear has been tested before and showcased in recent years, but another comes as a bit of an Internet surprise after soldiers posted photos to social media websites.

The Hawkeye is a 105 mm, Humvee-mounted artillery piece that`s made by AM General and Mandus Group. AM General makes Humvees, while the Mandus Group makes the a soft-recoil howitzer, which allows the cannon to fire from a lighter platform.

That same technology has been applied to the ""Brutus,"" a 155 mm Howitzer that soldiers recently fired for the first time from the back of a flatbed 5-ton cargo truck at the Maneuver Fires Integration Experiment, or MFIX, in late October at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Monica Guthrie, spokeswoman at Fort Sill, confirmed that the current MFIX does include the Hawkeye testing, along with other initiatives that include counter-drone technologies and directed energy, or laser, use.

She could not comment further on specific pieces of gear.

But, soldiers with the 75th Field Artillery Brigade posted photos and brief notes on the Brutus firing at MFIX.

""1LT Monika Lewandowska served as the Fire Direction Officer for the first ever round fired from the Brutus, an experimental 155mm forward recoiling howitzer mounted on an FMTV,"" read the caption accompanying the social media post. ""CPTs Keith Purdy and Phillip Sutton served as battery commander and battalion FDO during the Maneuver and Fires Integration Exercise at Fort Sill, OK.""

The photos and comments have since been removed from the brigade`s Facebook and Twitter pages.

But this isn`t the first Army mention of either the Hawkeye or the Brutus.

The Hawkeye was tested at a MFIX late last year.

It was lauded as a more mobile light artillery platform by Capts. Joseph Schmid and Adam Wilson in the May-June issues of ""Fires,"" the professional journal of the artillery community.

The pair of captains detailed lessons learned from artillery use in their article, ""U.S. artillery on the Korean Peninsula, Then and Now.""

""For example, we can reasonably assume a brigade will perform large amounts of artillery air assaults to move guns over non-trafficable ridgelines, high peaks and dangerous valleys,"" they wrote.

They compared the transport options with the current M119A3 for light artillery versus using lighter platforms such as the Hawkeye.

""… a battery commander can sling-load two full howitzer sections (one towed M119A3 and one prime mover per section) with four CH-47 Chinook helicopters. However, with the Hawkeye platform, a brigade can double its ability to project indirect Fires forward in support of a maneuver formation by sling-loading one Hawkeye SPH under each CH-47,"" they wrote.

The authors then referenced similar soft recoil work being done by Mandus on the Brutus, which has actually been in development by the company since at least 2012, according to its website.

Neither AM General nor Mandus Group responded to immediate requests for comment.

The Brutus moniker is a curious one, as there is a truck-mounted 155mm Howitzer in current use by the French military called the CAESAR. The acronym in French translates to ""truck equipped with an artillery system.""

The CAESAR has been used in Afghanistan and Mosul, Iraq. It was developed in the 1990s in a six-wheeled variant. An eight-wheeled version was showcased in 2015.

The Army does have a self-propelled 155 mm howitzer platform in the armored M109 Paladin, which has been undergoing its own improvement program. But it lacks the transport options of a Humvee-strapped howitzer.

Both the Hawkeye and Brutus fit, in part, descriptions laid out by Army Contracting Command back in February that looks for a ""Next Generation"" howitzer for the infantry brigade combat team and Stryker BCTs.

""The Government is interested in a single system replacement for the M119 and M777 towed howitzers currently fielded …,"" the fbo.gov posting noted.

They laid out some areas in which they were seeking new concepts or changes. Those included modifications to the existing artillery fleet, a short-tube 155mm Howitzer, ""integration of existing/developmental armaments into existing/developmental vehicle,"" and a ground up wheeled howitzer."
1101506,"Ever since the Air Force announced the development of the AC-130J Ghostrider to replace older generations of Lockheed Martin’s reliable fixed-wing gunship, Air Force Special Operations Command just can’t seem to resist slapping more guns on the thing.

In 2015, AFSOC added a 105mm cannon — basically a fucking howitzer normally reserved for armored ground vehicles — to the rear of the vessel at the insistence of former chief Lt. Gen. Bradley Heithold, supplementing the AC-130’s current arsenal of AGM-176A Griffin missiles, GBU-30 bombs, and a pre-existing 30mm cannon — making the gunship the most heavily armed in the Pentagon’s arsenal.

“We’ve got a bomb truck with guns on it now,” Heithold told Air Force Times in 2015, dubbing the Ghostrider “the ultimate battle plane.”

While AFSOC only got its hands on its first AC-130J gunship in October 2016, flown from Hurlburt Field to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to test out that brutal 105mm cannon, Air Force officials are most excited about the Ghostrider’s other big gun: a frickin’ laser beam.

While the use of high-powered lasers to knock out enemy electronics and destroy infrastructure was always part of the mix in the Ghostrider’s development, a new report from National Defense magazine says the “directed energy weapon” is “rapidly moving” from science fiction to practical integration with an aircraft at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. AFSOC officials are amped. From National Defense:

Using a high-energy laser, he aims and shoots at an electrical transformer, the engine of a pick-up truck, communication equipment stacked near the compound’s front door, and a drone sitting in the courtyard.

“Without the slightest bang, whoosh, thump, explosion, or even aircraft engine hum, four key targets are permanently disabled. The enemy has no communications, no escape vehicle, no electrical power and no retaliatory” intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability, said Lt. Gen. Brad Webb, commander of Air Force Special Operations Command, as he relayed the story.

“Minutes later, the team emerges from the compound, terrorist mastermind in hand. A successful raid,” he said.

“We’re no longer talking about bulky chemical lasers, but streamlined electrical lasers,” Webb told National Defense. “These pioneering scientists have honed the ability to combine smaller lasers into a finely-tuned, exquisite single laser. Beam control seems to no longer be an issue. Nor is the cooling technology needed … to keep the system operating.”

According to Air Force Times, Heithold initially proposed lasers as a countermeasure to enemy missiles, a defensive measure in place of the powerful 105mm cannon. But the idea eventually evolved into an offensive system capable of silently disabling enemy vehicles or infrastructure without firing a shot.

“The technology is ripe for doing this,” Heithold told the Air Force Association’s conference in September. “I’ve got the space, I’ve got the weight, and I’ve got the power.”

AFSOC hopes to see a combat operational AC-130J gunships by fiscal year 2018, with a fleet of 37 Ghostriders ready to bring the pain by 2020. But until then, AFSOC has a significant amount of testing to do: reducing vibrations to ensure a tight beam (!!!), integrating the weapons platform into an aircraft’s electrical systems, even just creating a “window” in the craft body from which a laser beam can actually shoot.

And beyond operational testing, funding challenges remain. Heithold, who left AFSOC in 2016, told National Defense that the Pentagon wants to invest $3.4 billion in directed-energy weapons across the entire DoD, and that the biggest roadblocks to a combat implementation might be the lack of a clear developmental roadmap (or, as usual, bickering).

But despite these potential obstacles, those who have seen the awesome power of the AC-130J Ghostrider are excited to see the gunship, bristling with firepower and futuristic weaponry, terrify enemies downrange sooner rather than later.

“Believe me,” Webb told National Defense, “this technology is quickly leaving the pages of science fiction.”"
1165638,"The Pentagon has plans to deploy its first ever ship-mounted laser next year, a disruptive, cutting-edge weapon capable of obliterating small boats and unmanned aerial vehicles with a blast of infrared energy.

Navy officials announced Monday that in early 2014, a solid-state laser prototype will be mounted to the fantail of the USS Ponce and sent to the 5th fleet region in the Middle East for real-world experience.

`It operates much like a blowtorch ... with an unlimited magazine.` - Navy official

Video released by the Navy shows the laser lock onto a slow-moving target, in this case an unmanned drone, which bursts aflame in mid-flight. The drone soon catches fire and crashes into the sea below.

""It operates much like a blowtorch ... with an unlimited magazine,"" one official said.

There are potential targets for the laser in the 5th fleet region, which includes the Persian Gulf, where Iran operates small surveillance drones and is known for swarming and harassing U.S. Navy ships with small, armored speed boats.

Navy researches say so far the laser is 12 for 12 in testing, destroying its targets 100 percent of the time. Officials who briefed the press on the laser gun -- which the Navy calls a ""directed energy pulse weapon"" -- say it has non-lethal functions too, and may be used to send warning signals to other vessels.

One of its major advantages, the Navy said, is its relatively low cost to operate. ""Its weapon round costs about $1 to shoot,"" said Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, chief of Naval Research. Although the unit cost is higher -- at around $32 million to produce.

Still, Navy officials say this is a major accomplishment when compared to the Airborne Laser, the Air Force`s now cancelled project to put nose-mounted lasers on its aircraft. Those lasers cost nearly $1.5 billion a piece.

“This wasn’t demonstrated on a barge. This was on a naval warship. And the performance results were quite astounding,” Klunder said.

There are some concerns with the new technology, however. Navy officials expressed worries with its ability to fire in poor weather conditions and believe the 5th fleet region will be a great test of the weapon’s abilities. It`s also unclear if the laser can effectively take down faster moving objects, such as fighter jets.

Officials also would not reveal the range of this new weapon, describing it as more of a ""close in"" system. Energy levels were also classified. If successful, it will eventually be painted Navy grey and mounted on top of the ship with the rest of the major weapons systems.

The Navy and other armed forces have been experimenting for years with these directed energy weapons -- laser guns to you and me. Such weapons could be the future of warfare.

In April 2011, the Navy conducted a more limited test of a similar weapon, blasting a boat from the water with a laser weapon. Nevin Carr, chief of Naval Research at the time, said this energy weapon would not handle all types of threats, however.

""To begin to address a cruise missile threat, we`d need to get up to hundreds of kilowatts,"" Carr said.

The Navy is working on just such a gun of course.

Called the FEL -- for free-electron laser, which doesn`t use a gain medium and is therefore more versatile -- it was tested in February 2011, consuming blistering amounts of energy and burning through feet of raw steel.

The FEL will easily get into the kilowatt power range, experts say. It can also be easily tuned as well, to adjust to environmental conditions, another reason it is more flexible than the fixed wavelength of solid-state laser. But the Navy doesn`t expect to release megawatt-class FEL weapons until the 2020s; among the obstacles yet to be overcome, the incredible power requirements of such weapons.

Also in the Navy`s futuristic arsenal: a so-called ""rail gun,"" which uses an electomagnetic current to accelerate a non-explosive bullet at several times the speed of sound. Railguns are even further off in the distance, possibly by 2025, the Navy has said.

But lasers? Forget Buck Rogers and the 25th century. They’re here today."
4228442,"Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said Wednesday that the ""the carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

He said the US carrier fleet - the most powerful naval force - is adapting to meet threats from rivals, such as China, that are openly talking about sinking them.

The admiral emphasized that carriers are hard to kill, calling them the ""most survivable airfield.""

US aircraft carriers are a ""tremendous expression of US national power,"" and that makes them a target for adversarial powers, the US Navy`s top admiral said Wednesday.

""The big thing that is occupying our minds right now is the advent of long-range precision weapons, whether those are land-based ballistic missiles, coastal-defense cruise missiles, you name it,"" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said at the Atlantic Council, adding that the systems wielded by adversaries are ""becoming more capable.""

Chinese media has recently been hyping its ""carrier-killer"" DF-26 ballistic missiles, which are reportedly able to hit targets as far as 3,500 miles away. China released footage of the Chinese military test-firing the missile last month.

The purpose is to send ""a clear message to the US about China`s growing missile capability, and that it can hold at risk US strategic assets, such as carriers and bases,"" Adam Ni, who researches China at Macquarie University in Sydney, recently told the South China Morning Post.

""There`s two sides, an offensive part and a defensive part,"" Richardson said Wednesday, stressing that the Navy`s carriers are adapting to the new threats. ""The advent of some of new technologies, particularly directed energy technologies coupled with the emerging power generation capabilities on carriers, is going to make them a much, much more difficult target to hit.""

Speaking with the crew of the new supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford on Tuesday, Richardson said, ""You are going to be able to host a whole cadre of weapons that right now we can just start to dream about. We`re talking about electric weapons, high energy laser, high-powered microwave [and] very, very capable radars.""

The expensive $13 billion carrier is expected to be deployed in the next few years.

""Rather than expressing the carrier as uniquely vulnerable, I would say it is the most survivable airfield within the field of fire,"" Richardson said Wednesday in response to questions about carrier vulnerability. ""This is an airfield that can move 720 miles a day that has tremendous self-defense capabilities.""

""If you think about the sequence of events that has to emerge to be able to target and hit something that can move that much, and each step in that chain of events can be disrupted from the sensing part all the way back to the homing part, it`s the most survivable airfield in the area,"" he said.

Richardson said the carrier is less vulnerable now than at any time since World War II, when the US Navy was putting carriers in action, and those carriers were in combat taking hits. ""The carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

US carriers are particularly hard, albeit not impossible, to kill.

3116122,"In 1978, the NASA scientist Donald Kessler predicted that a collision between two pieces of space junk could trigger a cascade of further impacts, creating dangerously large amounts of debris.

Kessler pointed out that when the rate at which debris forms is faster than the rate at which it de-orbits, then the Earth would become surrounded by permanent belts of junk, a scenario now known as the Kessler syndrome.

By some estimates, the Kessler syndrome has already become a reality. In January 2009, a collision between the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites created just this kind of cascade. Two years earlier, the Chinese military tested an anti-satellite weapon by destroying one of its own satellites called Fengyun 1C. Both incidents took place at altitudes of about 800 km.

Today, the European Space Agency’s Earth observing satellite, Envisat, orbits at about this height and is regularly threatened by potential impacts. Over 60 per cent of these threats can be traced back to the Iridium/Cosmos collision or the Fengyun incident.

But while space junk threatens most space operators, few have a real incentive to do anything about it. If a significant threat arises, it’s usually possible to move a satellite out of the way. That’s much cheaper than actually clearing the junk.

The result is a “tragedy of the commons” situation, where a common resource is exploited to the point where it becomes unusable.

Which is where a government agency like NASA comes in. Various ideas have been floated for removing space junk, most of them hugely expensive.

Today, James Mason at NASA Ames Research Center near Palo Alto and a few buddies describe a much cheaper option. Their idea is to zap individual pieces of junk with a ground-based laser, thereby slowing them down so that they eventually de-orbit.

Of course, laser removal isn’t entirely new. In the 1990s, the US Air Force studied the idea, thinking that a powerful enough laser could ablate an object, creating a force that could be used to de-orbit it. The trouble with this idea is that such a powerful laser has an obvious dual purpose, which is unlikely to please other space faring nations.

So Mason and pals have studied the possibility of using a much less powerful system which uses the momentum of photons alone to decelerate the junk. Focused onto a piece of junk for an hour or two every day, they calculate that a 5 KW laser could do the trick and that such a device could tackle up to ten objects a day.

That could help move junk away from potentially dangerous orbits and ultimately to de-orbit it entirely. In fact, Mason and co say that the system could reverse the Kessler syndrome, so that the rate of debris removal once again exceeds its rate of creation.

They say their system could even be used for manoeuvring suitably-designed satellites, without the need for them to carry propellant. Such a system could be marketed as a commercial venture, thereby helping to pay for it.

Not that it need be terribly expensive. Mason and co estimate that a test device could be knocked up for a million dollars, which would have to be shared by many spacefaring nations, to avoid the inevitable legal issues that using such a device would raise.

Of course, the US (and obviously China), already have the technology to this kind of work, using their own antisatellite systems. Indeed, Mason and co say “it may be possible to perform a near-zero cost demonstration using existing capabilities such as those of the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland AFB.”

It’s only a matter of time before a piece of space junk causes serious havoc in orbit, by threatening a crewed mission, for example. There’ll be plenty of interest in this kind of technology after such an incident. And then we’ll be asking why we didn’t invest in the technology when we had the chance to prevent this kind of disaster.

Correction–15 March 2011

In response to this post, NASA Public Affairs Office sent the following:

James Mason, author from the Universities Space Research Association, would like a few points clarified about the following sentences:

1) “Today, James Mason at NASA Ames Research Center near Palo Alto and a few buddies…”

James Mason is of Universities Space Research Association (USRA). The work was a collaboration between USRA, Stanford University and NASA Ames: Mason and Marshall are funded by USRA. Stupl is funded by Stanford. Levit is a NASA civil servant.

2) “Focused onto a piece of junk for an hour or two every day, they calculate that a 5 KW laser could do the trick”

The “trick” is to only displace the object by a tiny amount, thereby preventing a collision. This laser’s effect would be far too weak to rapidly affect the decay of the object’s orbit. To actually de-orbit a debris object with a laser requires forces about 1,000 times more powerful. To “ultimately de-orbit it entirely” would take about the same amount of time as if we had not illuminated it - this may well take decades, depending on the object.

3) “Mason and co estimate that a test device could be knocked up for a million dollars”

The laser alone would cost about a million dollars (it is a commercially available industrial laser). The actual cost of an operation system (including telescope, adaptive optics etc) is unclear, but is likely to be at least tens of millions.

4) “Of course, the US (and obviously China), already have the technology to this kind of work, using their own antisatellite systems. Indeed, Mason and co say “it may be possible to perform a near-zero cost demonstration using existing capabilities such as those of the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland AFB.”“

“antisatellite systems” may be too strong. The existing military technology is probably mainly for (at the moment) tracking and imaging other satellites. The Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland probably has most of what would be needed to do a technology demonstration, however we stress in the paper that this system should be done as an international collaboration because of the obvious security implications.

Also, Jan Stupl, also an author from Stanford University, made a comment on the following sentence:

“Their idea is to zap individual pieces of junk with a ground-based laser, thereby slowing them down so that they eventually de-orbit.”

Our piece is about collision avoidance, not about de-orbiting. Same is true for the deadline: it is not about ‘removing’ space junk, but ‘moving’…"
4377521,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just when it looks like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may restart his ballistic missile testing program, U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed trimming the missile defense budget, as one set of deterrents is delayed by two years.

FILE PHOTO - A flight test of the exercising elements of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is launched by the 30th Space Wing and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency at the Vandenberg AFB, California June 22, 2014. REUTERS/Gene Blevins

The U.S. Missile Defense Agency - charged with developing, testing and fielding a ballistic missile defense system - will delay the expansion of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system by two years because of a delay in the redesign of the Raytheon Co-made “kill vehicle” the system uses.

A “kill vehicle” pops off the top of the defending missile above the Earth’s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile’s warhead.

The GMD is a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles based in Alaska and California, and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS.

The expansion of the field of interceptors in Alaska from 44 ground-based interceptors, or GBIs, to 64 had been slated for completion in 2023. But the delay, due to technical issues and not connected to the cut in the agency’s budget, now means that the placement of the additional 20 interceptors will not be operational until 2025, the MDA said on Tuesday.

“The important thing is to get it right, and if we’re going to build more GBI’s, we want to put the best kill vehicle on the top of it,” said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

At the same time, North Korea has been pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program after a summit meeting between Kim and Trump in Hanoi ended abruptly on Feb. 28 without an agreement on denuclearization.

New activity has been detected at a North Korean ICBM plant, South Korean media said on Thursday, as Trump said he would be “very disappointed” if Pyongyang rebuilt a rocket site.

In the budget, the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, saw its appropriation cut by $1 billion to $9.4 billion.

Michelle Atkinson, chief financial officer of the MDA, told reporters, “What you are seeing in ‘20 actually looks like a decrease, but it’s really just the declining funding,” as the agency comes off recent financial injections.

Trump’s smaller request comes on the heels of a significant budget boost last year after several North Korean missile tests.

The MDA projected a budget of $9.2 billion in 2021, and $9.1 billion in 2022, continuing the trend of declining funding.

One Pentagon-wide effort in lasers that could be used to defeat missiles saw investment slow dramatically. After nearly doubling just the MDA’s budget for directed energy from $109 million in 2018 to $224 million in 2019, the Pentagon as a whole plans to invest only $235 million in the technology in fiscal 2020.

Among other proposals included in a recently published Missile Defense Review is one involving lasers mounted on drones - aimed at stopping missiles just after takeoff in what is called the boost phase.

During this portion of the flight the missile is most vulnerable, flying at its slowest speed, easily detected by the heat from its engines and incapable of evading interceptors as it accelerates to break out of the Earth’s atmosphere."

Los voraces incendios forestales registrados el pasado mes de octubre en California fueron los más mortíferos en la historia de la región estadounidense. Dejaron decenas de muertos y cerca de 700 desaparecidos. Pero algunas publicaciones en internet están avivando todavía más el fuego.

En YouTube, una serie de videos con teorías conspirativas han alcanzado millones de visitas.

A la hora de buscar clips sobre los incendios en California, el sitio de videos de Google muestra material plagado de noticias falsas, según reveló en un informe el sitio de noticias tecnológicas Motherboard.

Getty Images Hay cientos de personas desaparecidas tras los incendios.

“YouTube no ha impedido adecuadamente que estas teorías conspirativas florezcan en su plataforma”, denuncia el sitio web.

La compañía de videos dijo que se había comprometido a combatir la desinformación. Algunos de esos archivos fueron eliminados, pero muchos todavía se pueden ver en la plataforma.

De acuerdo con Motherboard, YouTube no solo permitió la publicación de los videos sino que además recomienda a quienes busquen información sobre ellos temáticas como “conspiracy 2018” (conspiración 2018), “directed energy weapon” (arma de energía dirigida) y “laser beam” (rayo láser).

BBC Mundo te cuenta qué hay detrás de esas teorías conspirativas y cómo consiguieron hacerse tan populares en YouTube.

“Fueron originados con armas láser”

Algunos de los videos sugieren incluso que los incendios fueron originados de manera deliberada con armas láser desde una aeronave.

Para respaldar sus argumentos usan imágenes manipuladas o fuera de contexto.

Youtube En algunos videos se cuenta que los incendios no fueron generados de manera “normal”.

Algunos de esos videos fueron publicados por internautas que defienden que la Tierra es plana -la llamada “reina de las teorías conspirativas- o por el sitio InfoWars, también conocido por difundir teorías de la conspiración.

“Quienes creen en esta falsa teoría conspirativa piensan que el gobierno de Estados Unidos disparó armas de energía dirigidas, o láseres, desde un avión para provocar incendios en objetivos predeterminados”, se lee en el reporte de Motherboard.

En este video, por ejemplo, se asegura que los incendios de California “no son normales” y que “fueron resultado de una tecnología llamada armas de energía dirigidas”.

Agenda 21

“El objetivo del supuesto ataque (con armas láser) -que realmente no ocurrió- sería sustentar una interpretación absurda de Agenda 21, un plan de Naciones Unidas de 1992 para promover el desarrollo sostenible”, dice el reporte.

Según esa teoría, el plan de Naciones Unidas atacaría directamente la propiedad privada. El objetivo principal sería el estado de California.

“Es todo parte de Agenda 21, quieren obligar a que la gente se vaya de California, literalmente”, se lee en los comentarios de algunos videos.

Esa teoría conspirativa también fue muy difundida a través de Twitter.

¿Cómo se popularizaron esos videos en YouTube?

YouTube ha sido criticado por fallar a la hora de limitar las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma.

Sus recomendaciones y resultados de búsqueda son generados por algoritmos que pueden haber sido manipulados por quienes producen los videos para que ese contenido se vuelva viral.

Los críticos de la plataforma dicen que los algoritmos son cada vez más sensacionalistas y reaccionarios.

Sin embargo, YouTube le dijo a Motherboard que la sección de noticias de última hora de su portada extrae videos de fuentes confiables.

“Durante los últimos años hemos trabajando para mostrar fuentes creíbles en nuestro sitio web a quienes buscan temas relacionados con esas noticias”, dijo la compañía en un comunicado.

Esta no es la primera vez que YouTube y su compañía paraguas, Google, son acusadas de hacer todo lo contrario a ofrecer información útil y precisa.

Al preguntar si Barack Obama estaba planeando un golpe de estado, el parlante inteligente Google Home usó una teoría de la conspiración de un sitio de dudosa confiabilidad.

Google está constantemente modificando su algoritmo de búsqueda para asegurarse de que genera mejores resultados, pero se enfrenta a un ejército de oponentes, con fines comerciales o maliciosos, determinados a desviarlo hacia otra dirección.

Se ha culpado mucho a Facebook por la propagación de noticias falsas, pero YouTube puede ser una plataforma más influyente entre los jóvenes.

Looks Might Be Deceiving Gross domestic product at market exchange rates, 2016 Source: World Bank

But this comparison is misleading, because things cost different amounts in different countries. Gross domestic product is supposed to measure the amount of real stuff -- cars, phones, financial services, back massages, etc. -- that a country produces. If the same phone costs $400 in the U.S. but only $200 in China, China’s GDP is getting undercounted by 50 percent when we measure at market exchange rates. In general, less developed countries have lower prices, which means their GDP gets systematically undercounted.

Economists try to correct for this with an adjustment called purchasing power parity (PPP), which controls for relative prices. It’s not perfect, since it has to account for things like product quality, which can be hard to measure. But it probably gives a more accurate picture of how much a country really produces. And here, China has already surpassed the U.S.:

If you don’t trust the murky PPP adjustments, a simple alternative is just to look at the price of a Big Mac. The same burger costs 1.8 times more in the U.S. than in China. Adjusting the market-exchange-rate GDP numbers by that ratio would put China even farther ahead.

In some dimensions, China’s lead is even larger. The country’s manufacturing output overtook that of the U.S. almost a decade ago. Its exports are more than a third larger as well.

American commentators may be slow to recognize China’s economic supremacy, but the rest of the world is starting to wake up to the fact:

Appearances Matter Survey of perception of economic power in developed nations Source: Pew Research Center

This doesn’t mean China`s population is the world’s richest -- far from it. The countries with the highest income per person, in order, are Qatar, Luxembourg, Singapore, Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. But few would argue that Qatar or Luxembourg is the world’s leading economy -- while per-capita numbers are important for the well-being of a nation’s people, they don’t translate into comprehensive national power unless a country also has a large population.

China’s modest per-person income simply means that the country has plenty of room to grow. Whereas developed countries can only get richer by inventing new things or making their economies more efficient, poor countries can cheaply copy foreign technology or imitate foreign organizational practices. That doesn’t always happen, of course -- many poor countries find themselves trapped by dysfunctional institutions, lack of human capital or other barriers to development.

But there’s good reason to think that China will overcome at least some of these obstacles. Economists Randall Morck and Bernard Yeung have a new paper comparing the histories of Japan and South Korea -- both of which climbed out of poverty to achieve rich-country status -- with the recent rise of China. They find that China’s institutions are, broadly speaking, developing along the same path followed by its successful neighbors.

In other words, not only is China already the world’s largest economy, the gap between it and the U.S. can be expected to grow even wider. This continues to be borne out in the growth statistics -- though China has slowed in recent years, its economy continues to expand at a rate of more than 6 percent, while the U.S. is at just over 2 percent. If that disparity persists, China’s economy will be double that of the U.S. in less than two decades.

So economically, China has surpassed the U.S., and is on track to zoom far ahead in the near future. But what about military power? Here, it still looks like the U.S. reigns supreme. It spends more money on its military than China, has a larger nuclear arsenal, and -- thanks to its recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- has a more seasoned fighting force as well.

But that doesn’t mean that the U.S. would win a war, if the two countries fought. A full nuclear exchange, of course, would have no winners. But in a protracted conventional struggle, there’s a good chance that China’s weight of numbers and manufacturing prowess would win out. As an analogy, consider the U.S. and Japan in World War II. At the beginning of the war, Japan’s aircraft carrier force outnumbered that of the U.S., and its navy was far more seasoned (due to Japan’s war in China). But when the war began, the U.S. greatly outproduced its opponent:

The U.S. also had a 2-to-1 manpower advantage. When two countries of similar technology levels fight, numbers tend to tell. China has a larger GDP, more manufacturing output and four times the population. And as its recent advances in stealth technology, directed energy weapons, hypersonic missiles and other areas demonstrate, its military technology isn’t that far behind the U.S. In a drawn-out war, once the mighty Chinese steamroller got moving, it would be unstoppable.

In other words, China is now in a position similar to that of the U.S. at about the turn of the 20th century -- a formidable superpower that just hasn’t yet felt any reason to exercise its dominance. Once the U.S. woke up to the need to throw its weight around, no one doubted its primacy.

China may never make the same decision. It may choose to remain restrained on the international stage, with a modest nuclear arsenal and a light footprint in global institutions. If so, its dominance will remain a lurking, looming potentiality instead of a real and present fact of life.

But I wouldn`t count on that happening.

2948051,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday came out with new rules scaling back Obama-era constraints on coal-fired power plants, striking at one of the former administration`s legacy programs to rein in climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency called the Obama-era regulations on coal power plants ""overly prescriptive and burdensome.""

The Trump administration plan broadly increases the leeway given states to decide how and how much to regulate coal power plants. The EPA says it ""empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.""

Combined with the EPA`s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move may actually increase the country`s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump`s ""Dirty Power Plan.""

Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer`s wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. ""Once again, this administration is choosing polluters` profits over public health and safety,"" he said.

Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration`s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

The new proposal establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing any plans to limit climate-changing emissions from power plants. Critics say the new plan would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often and extend the plants` overall operating life, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry. The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country`s power producers to natural gas, wind and solar power, and other less-polluting power sources.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a ""war on coal"" waged by Obama.

""They are continuing to play to their base and following industry`s lead,"" Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed, said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. ""This is all about coal at all costs."""

When she’s not at work, Armstrong enjoys participating in area road races, traveling to foreign countries, and watching really bad reality TV.

Controversy over the fate of the statue honoring the late Mayor Frank L. Rizzo has quieted for the moment.

I’d like to think it’s because everyone’s been busy coming up with novel ideas for replacing or relocating it and submitting them to the city — but that’s wishful thinking.

You’ll recall that the Office of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy has asked city residents to submit suggestions for the statue’s future. But the response so far has been lukewarm. Only about 2,700 people have bothered to fill out the online questionnaire or mail in their ideas.

I really was surprised when I heard that.

Given how polarizing a figure Rizzo still is, the city should have been deluged with responses. Bring up the subject of what to do with the statue in front of the Municipal Services Building and everybody has an opinion.

You’d think that given the current mood in the country, with folks angling to remove statues of Confederate soldiers and other less-than-honorable historical figures, things would be at a fever pitch in Philly. But no, that’s not the case.

Meanwhile, it’s as if some other parts of America have awakened from a long slumber and are taking a fresh look at the sins of people we honor and gone, “Ugh, what were we thinking?” Earlier this week, the National Cathedral in Washington, which has been the site of funerals for numerous U.S. presidents, announced plans to remove stained-glass windows honoring Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Meanwhile, Democratic U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) this week cosponsored a bill to have similarly offensive remembrances removed from the Capitol.

In Minneapolis, there’s a grassroots effort to remove a statue of Christopher Columbus and replace it with none other than Prince, the flamboyant entertainer who died of a drug overdose in his hometown back in 2016.

“We, the undersigned, do not believe that Columbus represents the values Minnesotans carry,” a petition on Organizefor.org reads. “Rather than glorify a man who wanted to extinguish black and Native peoples, we should honor members of our community.”

In Portsmouth, Va., there’s talk of replacing a reviled Confederate monument with one of hometown heroine Missy Elliott. “Missy is all of us. Missy is everything the Confederacy was not,” a petition on Change.org reads. So, far it has attracted more than 30,000 supporters.

It’s hard to say if either of these out-of-the-box efforts will gain traction. I bring them up to help get folks thinking. I mean, if Philly wants to honor a favored son, such as, say, actor/entertainer Will Smith, that wouldn’t be out of the question. But first, the ideas have to be presented. People have to participate in the process. So, I ask: What are you waiting for? C’mon, Philly. This is something you’re passionate about. I see it in your Facebook posts. I hear you talking about it on the radio. Now’s your chance to be heard.

The commission will review the Rizzo-related submissions and decide in late September whether to start the formal process to remove or relocate public art. That would be followed by a 30-day notice to the sculptor and a public hearing, possibly in October. If you don’t want to use the internet, mail your ideas to:

I know you’re busy. Plus, a lot of you feel talk of moving the statue is misdirected energy.

“There’s more important issues that plague Philadelphia with a black cloud,” Darisha Miller, a public relations guru, wrote me recently. “It’s why I’m strongly opposed to any further discussion of a statue.”

She’s right.

But Thomas Paine Plaza is right across from City Hall. I really don’t think visitors should be greeted by a hulking statue of a politician known for antagonizing African Americans and members of the LGBTQ population, and who once called on voters to “vote white.”

Whatever you think of Rizzo, fill out the form. It doesn’t take much time. Stop procrastinating. You have until next Friday to get it in.

4636312,"The US Air Force successfully shot down multiple missiles with a laser weapon that could eventually defend fighters and other aircraft against existing and emerging missile threats.

The Air Force`s Self-Protect High-Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program is developing a new directed-energy weapon on a pod that could be used to protect US aircraft from surface-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles.

The program recently achieved an important milestone when a ground-based unit eliminated multiple air-launched missiles during testing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force announced Friday.

The Demonstrator Laser Weapon System tested recently appears to be a proof-of-concept testing asset.

The final SHiELD weapon will be smaller, lighter, and more suited to use in a harsher airborne environment, according to the Air Force, and the recent test was a step in the right direction.

""The successful test is a big step ahead for directed energy systems and protection against adversarial threats,"" Air Force Research Laboratory commander Maj. Gen. William Cooley said in a statement. ""The ability to shoot down missiles with speed of light technology will enable air operation in denied environments.""

Dr. Kelly Hammett, the director of AFRL`s Directed Energy Directorate, said that this capability has the potentially to be a ""game changer for our warfighters.""

A Lockheed Martin test pilot recently told an audience that America`s sixth-generation fighter could be armed with directed-energy weapons, according to USNI News. Lockheed is one of three defense contractors involved in the SHiELD program, according to Air Force Magazine.

The Air Force has previously suggested that this system could be used to protect not only advanced fighters but also bombers, tankers, and transport aircraft in high-risk environments, such as the difficult-to-penetrate anti-access zones that US great-power rivals are creating.

Unlike traditional countermeasures, this defensive could offer endless protection against a variety of threats, making it a potentially revolutionary concept. The Air Force is probably still a few years out from demonstrating a working prototype of the final SHiELD laser, The Drive reports."

Transcript, via Hugh Hewitt Show:













HUGH HEWITT, HOST: I’m joined by my friend, Congressman Tim Ryan from the great state of Ohio, from Niles and Warren, in fact. Congressman, are you in The Land? Or are you back inside the Beltway…uh oh, Congressman Ryan, are you on…



REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): I’m in The Land.



HH: Oh, good. You should be back here. Don’t you have first day at work tomorrow?



TR: Yeah, I’ll be there tonight late.



HH: All right. First question, Ohio State last night, you’ve got to say they should have been in the Final Four, don’t you think?



TR: There’s no doubt about it, no doubt about it. I mean, you know, when you watch even the Georgia game and how they played last night, you think Ohio State’s got to be there. I think they need to move to a bigger tournament. They need to move to at least an 8-team playoff.



HH: That is, they just got screwed, and they looked good last night. They laid off a little bit in the second half, but they still looked good. And the Browns, Congressman, I have to think this is the first time you and I have felt optimistic about our club in a long time.



TR: Unbelievable. I mean, Baker, Baker, Money Maker. I’m so pumped. I mean, it feels like I’ve got another day in the week back with my Sundays now, so it’s unbelievable.



HH: There you go. There you go. So that’s next year. Let’s talk about this year. Are you and Nancy Pelosi getting along after your challenge to her speakership a few years ago?



TR: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we get along fine. You know, a lot, we kept it professional the entire way. I mean, I clearly had some opinions that I expressed numerous times publicly, but you know, at some point, you’ve got to start governing the country. And we’re in the majority now in the House.



HH: Now I want to tell people you are on the House Appropriations Committee. More importantly, not only are you in House Appropriations, you’re on the Defense subcommittee. Two years ago, we approved $700 billion dollars in spending, last year $716. The President’s request is going to be $750. Tim Ryan, this is your number one job to get this right. Do you think we’ll get an appropriations bill out of the House that’s near the President’s request and over to the Senate?



TR: I hope so. I think we will. I mean, we’ve got to make the bigger argument, and here’s the problem I see, Hugh, with the 24 hour news cycle that the President gets himself wrapped up in, the constant back and forth, the chaos. We’re losing the larger narrative of our relationship in the world with our allies, our relationship in the world with China, and our relationship with Russia. China is coming at us. They are in Africa. They are locking down long-term deals in Africa for raw materials. They’re building islands in the South China Sea. They’ve got very detailed, long-term programs like their One Belt, One Road, where they’re connecting Asia to the Middle East. They’ve got a Make It In China 2025, where they’re really trying to take over manufacturing in the world. They’re investing hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, wind, solar, high-speed rail. And we aren’t even acting like we’re in a competition with them. And the Defense budget with the technologies that are in there, and look, we’ve got to audit the Defense Department. We’ve got to make sure we’re not wasting money. But we are falling behind in major technologies in weapons systems that we can’t afford to fall back on.



HH: Well, that’s music to my ears. Do your colleagues on the Democratic side, because you’ll be in the majority now, do they agree with you on Approps? And will they agree with you in Rules? And will it get to the floor and get to the Senate?



TR: Well, we’re going to find out. You know, we’ve got a pretty diverse coalition in the Democratic caucus right now. But again, you know, we have got to make sure every member of the Democratic caucus and the country understand this competition. And if you’re in this competition, and China is overtaking us in so many ways, Russia doesn’t have quite as strong of an economic hand as China does, but they are playing their hand pretty well, militarily. And we’ve got to compete with them as well. If you don’t understand that competition, you’re not going to understand the need. One of the provisions we’ve got to continue to push, too, Hugh, is when we’re making things through the Defense Department, when we’re signing these big contracts, that this stuff is made in the United States, that this stuff is made in areas that have lost manufacturing so that the tax dollars aren’t just serving a great national purpose with our Defense industry and our foreign policy and hard and soft power, but it’s also creating jobs in areas that need job creation to happen.



HH: Now you know, the Chinese are putting one ship in the water every single month. We’re not even close to that. Do you think that you’re going to get, do you think the acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan being an acquisition guy is going to figure out how to lay out for the House a detailed set of acquisition instructions?



TR: I hope so. You know, I think really all my disagreements with what’s happening with the government today, I think Secretary Mattis put together really the only comprehensive long-term plan for acquisition, technology, and readiness within, and creating a lethal force within the National Defense Strategy. It is comprehensive. It is detailed. I hope we just continue to execute what he’s put forward, him and his team have put forward, and that includes acquisition. And this is another reason, too, Hugh, I mean, we don’t have to build every sub if we have allies that have submarines, too. And so people say well, what the hell do we need to be friends with this country or that country. Well, if you peel the onion back one layer, you realize well, they’ve got five submarines and they help us in Iraq, and they help us in Syria, and they help us here and they help us there. Those are costs and expenses we don’t have to incur, because we have friends. And so yeah, we’ve got to build more submarines, because we are falling behind. But we also have to make sure we keep those relationships with our allies, because we utilize their material and their weapon systems, too.



HH: All right, last question on this. I don’t think of China as a friend, and I don’t think of them as a near-peer competitor. I think of them as a peer competitor that has not taken military action off the table, nor will they ever. Do you agree with my assessment, Tim Ryan?



TR: I sure do. I sure do.



HH: That puts you in the part of the Democratic Party that I remember as the Scoop Jackson Democrats. When are you going to Iowa next, Congressman Ryan?



TR: (laughing) I don’t have any trips planned to Iowa or New Hampshire, but I am getting invited a lot to those two states. So I may end up making another road trip.



HH: Do you have any plans on making an announcement on seeking the presidency?



TR: I’m going to make a decision in the coming weeks. Yeah, I’m going to…



HH: You’re going to do that on this show, I assume?



TR: Oh, well, of course.



HH: Of course.



TR: (laughing)



HH: You know, California starts voting absentee the same day that the Iowa Caucuses happen, and it votes for 30 straight days, and it’s millions of votes. I’m on in every major market in California. I’m sure curious what do Democrats do about this situation if they’re thinking about the presidency?



TR: Well, I mean, look, this is politics. These are elections. You start and you win. I mean, that, to me, is how you get elected. I mean, it’s not brain surgery. You get elected. If a candidate pops in Iowa, it’s certainly going to help them the next 30 days in the California early vote. And if you can get over to New Hampshire and get another win and get a lot of momentum, that’s going to help you as well. But if looks like from the rumors that there may be two, three, maybe even four different candidates from California, which will divide up the California vote and you know, so that would make anybody eligible to maybe pull something off over there. So it’s complicated, but there, those four early states are going to be key for anybody, especially somebody like me who would come out. I’m not from New York. I’m not going to have all the money or the power centers in the country. So it’s imperative for an outsider candidate to win Iowa and New Hampshire and then keep going.



HH: Is it okay to call you a Scoop Jackson Democrat? Does that, is that okay in your party anymore, or do you have to run from that title?



TR: I don’t know if anybody remembers Scoop Jackson, but you can. You know, again, I think, like you can’t participate in a global economy without a strong military. It just doesn’t make any sense. And if you know, Democrats need to make sure that on these issues of security, whether it’s securing the border or securing our national defense and protecting our interests around the world, especially you know, when it comes to climate, we’ve got to be engaged. And you know, you can’t do that without a strong military.



HH: Let me turn to two local issues. Number one, Lordstown, they took $50 billion dollars in federal aid. You and I both grew up with people who were working on the line or had kids in our school when they were working on, our teachers would work there in the summertime. That’s a death blow to the Valley. What do you hear from GM?



TR: I’ve got to tell you, Hugh, it has been devastating. I mean, you grew up not far from where I grew up in the same county. And to watch these families now leave, you know, we hear about family separation at the border. Well, there’s family separation happening right now in Trumbull County, Ohio, where the dad or the mom has to leave the family to go to Tennessee or go to Arlington, Texas, or go, and they’re literally going to commute and leave the family, because the kids are in high school, and they’re established, and it’s sickening what’s happening. I don’t know what GM’s going to do. I had several conversations with Mary Barra. But this is all coming down to contract negotiations, you know, with the local unions from around the country. And then they’re going to figure out from those contract negotiations which product goes where. And we’re hoping that Lordstown, Ohio is in the mix. What makes you sick, too, look, they got the bailout, right? They got the rescue package which I voted for and supported. And then they got $157 million dollars this past year in the tax cut. And then they cut 14,000 jobs and their stock goes up 6%. Now what’s wrong with that economic model there?



HH: There’s a lot. And I’ll tell you, when you take government money, you don’t do that. If it’s a private company without government money, it’s fine by me. But that is just a pure, that’s a private-public partnership that ought not to screw Ohio. Last question, Ravenna. The missile defense agency is going to have to decide someday about the East Coast missile defense system. And if they put it in Ravenna, that makes sense to me. What do you hear, Tim Ryan?



TR: I haven’t heard much. They’re, they keep delaying the decision. I’m not sure they’re going to keep the program. It, Mattis said he wanted it to go back for further review. This was several months ago. We feel like we have the best option here for the East Coast missile defense fund. Again, this is what I mentioned earlier about spending Defense money in areas that would really benefit to have $3-4 billion dollars in economic impact and 800 full-time jobs when it was all said and done in a region in Northeast Ohio that could really use it. That’s how you want to be spending your Defense money. It meets a national purpose, national Defense purpose, but also has economic impact. I hope that happens. We haven’t heard. Maybe with the new secretary now, we’ll get some word. But I’m hoping we move forward with it, not just to authorize the program, but to fund the program.



HH: You kown, Dr. Griffin, who’s the chief technology officer at the Pentagon, said at CSIS a couple weeks ago, “I think everybody is aware that the last time we really invested in transformative capabilities was in the Reagan era. We introduced stealth fighters, stealth aircraft. We introduced GPS precision-guided munitions, high-data encrypted communications, things that were really transformative.” We’ve got to get back in that game. I think it starts in Ravenna, because we’ve got to be ready to intercept this stuff – hypersonics and all of them.



TR: Yeah, no question about it. I mean, directed energy, there’s a lot of technologies that we’re behind on, and we’ve got to make investments in. And like I said, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, I think most people want to see that those products are being built and assembled and manned and fixed in the United States to the extent we can do that.



HH: Amen. Amen. All right, well, you’re a Scoop Jackson Democrat to me, Tim Ryan, and you’re a Browns and a Buckeye fan, so have a great start to 2019. I’ll see you inside the Beltway.



TR: You, too. Take care, Hugh. Thanks.



HH: Thank you."
5125142,"Texas A&M, along with the Texas legislature, are throwing a major investment into Army Futures Command with a $130 million facility that aims to make A&M ""the hypersonics research capital of the country,"" the university system said in a press release.

The facility — being built at the Texas A&M Systems` RELLIS Campus in Bryan, Texas, which is just minutes from College Station — will allow AFC to further develop its modernized technologies, the press release says. A&M will be building a $50 million building to hold laboratories and AFC offices, and putting another $30 million into the new facility`s infrastructure.

The Texas legislature is putting up an additional $50 million toward the project for an ""innovative proving ground."" The new complex is also going to include a kilometer-long tunnel for testing hypersonics.

A&M made its desire to collaborate with the Army clear in November when the head of the command, Gen. John ""Mike"" Murray, visited the campus after naming Austin, Texas and the University of Texas System the headquarters for AFC.

""There is not a question you can ask us that the answer is not yes,"" A&M Chancellor John Sharp told Murray at the time, per Texas Monthly.

""We are humbled and grateful to the people of Texas, Texas elected leaders, and the Texas A&M University System for the opportunity to further develop our strategic partnership through the establishment of the combat development complex on the RELLIS Campus,"" Murray said in the A&M press release. ""This effort will certainly prove vital as we work together to discover, develop, and test ideas and concepts that will help our soldiers, and our future soldiers, to protect America`s tomorrows — beginning today.""

The new combat development complex isn`t expected to be completed until June 2021, the press release says, and could draw other companies to Bryan that are interested in working with AFC. One of the benefits of building the complex at RELLIS — aside from its proximity to Fort Hood and AFC headquarters in Austin — is its closeness to Texas A&M`s College of Engineering and Disaster City, ""the world`s largest search and rescue training facility that can double as a training site for urban warfare,"" according to the press release.

As Task & Purpose`s (unofficial) senior Texas correspondent, I can`t help but wonder if AFC is aware of the crippling, all-consuming rivalry between UT and A&M? Is the Army taking full advantage of that primal need to compete in order to further their goals? And furthermore, is AFC ever going to work with the only good Texas university — Texas Tech?

Texas Tech and Army Futures Command have not yet responded to Task & Purpose on whether they have spoken about possible collaboration in the future.

As a Texas Tech graduate, it physically pains me to write anything about A&M and UT that does not include trashing their football teams and asserting Red Raider dominance. The US-China-Russia great power competition has nothing on UT-A&M-Texas Tech.

Cut me a freakin` break here, y`all — and wreck `em, Tech."
701682,"The voice on the handset says “We are in two-way contact,” and the scientists gathered respond with cheers. The operations team has just confirmed that the spacecraft, OSIRIS-REx, is alive and healthy. It had been buzzing the Earth as planned, a mere 34,448 miles above the planet’s surface and too close for contact, this spacecraft the size of a UPS truck coursing along at 19,000 miles per hour. After 55 minutes of radio silence, it was now singing, outbound from Earth and on a new trajectory to an alien world. The plan had worked: The Earth gravity assist, as it is called, was a success. It is Friday, September 22, 2017. One year ago, OSIRIS-REx launched from Florida for the asteroid Bennu. Spacecraft rarely, however, make direct flights from one world to another. To save fuel, they swing around the solar system, borrowing the gravity of other celestial objects to adjust speed and direction. OSIRIS-REx’s trajectory took it from Earth, around the sun, and back to Earth for this, its second launch of sorts. The spacecraft plowed into the wash of southern Earth’s gravity, flying nearest to Australia and Antarctica before whipping under and up, physics firing it from the solar system’s orbital plane and sending it racing for rendezvous with Bennu.

Once it arrives, OSIRIS-REx will map every meter of the asteroid, record its resources, and eventually grab a sample to bring back home. Bennu is a pristine chunk of the ancient solar system, nudged near Earth over the last 4 billion years by happenstance and orbital mechanics. By understanding Bennu, planetary scientists can get a grip on how a swirling cloud of dust and gas could coalesce into a solar system capable of creating life. Our solar system is only 4.6 billion years old; Bennu, then, is like a wormhole to the beginning of us. * * * Here at the Michael Drake Building of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, voices from spacecraft operations continue conversing across the VOCA (the Voice Operational-Communications Assembly, a sort of secure phone for teams to talk), and Estelle Church, the team’s science-systems engineer here temporarily from Lockheed Martin, turns to her computer. The spacecraft dashboard on-screen begins populating with updated telemetry data. Temperatures, currents, voltages, instrument states—down the line, everything is nominal. Church works alongside Sara Knutson, the mission’s lead science-operations engineer, who is overseeing the science side of the maneuver. There was practically zero chance that the spacecraft might be destroyed or auger into the Earth during the gravity assist: The laws of physics would not have allowed it. But the onboard computer might have announced an anomaly, or the spacecraft itself might have gone into “safe mode” (in the same way that desktop computers can at home), leaving engineers to puzzle together what happened. OSIRIS-REx could rewrite the history of the solar system. In space exploration, everything builds on what has come before. When OSIRIS-REx flew by the Earth, all of its instruments were switched off, preventing any data collection in the moments of passing. The instruments didn’t have to be off, but back when NASA’s Juno spacecraft, which is now circling Jupiter, performed its own Earth gravity assist in 2013, it swept Terra with its science payload plugging away. Its computer got tripped up, and the spacecraft went to sleep. Juno wasn’t hotdogging with its flyby—opportunistic science is part of every space mission—and the spacecraft did recover, but a lesson was learned. OSIRIS-REx kept its complement cold for its brief dance with Earth’s gravity, and would study our home only afterward.

Now, with Earth growing smaller by the second for the speeding spacecraft, the scientists are free to reactivate the instruments to commence a science-observation campaign. They warm up its instruments and train them on the Earth for calibration and data collection. Our planet is perfect for this, because scientists have a solid grip on its fundamentals. If there are odd variations between known Earth data and those collected by OSIRIS-REx, the instrument teams can make adjustments accordingly. Perhaps the most exciting science to be performed today involves the camera. The team hopes to get a clear “pale-blue dot” shot of the Earth. OSIRIS-REx will arrive at Bennu next August, which means less than one year remains for the team to refine their processes and learn their instruments not as simulations, but as functioning machines of science. For 13 years now, they have attempted to think through and rehearse every contingency, and cultivate a solid workflow for science and operations. Dante Lauretta, who leads the mission as its principal investigator and who, along with the late Michael Drake of the University of Arizona, conceived the mission and made it a reality, says that if every policy, procedure, and lesson learned were printed out, it would be millions of pages long. And yet Bennu remains inscrutable, a wholly uncooperative celestial object. Nobody knows what, exactly, they will find there. Scientists have the broad strokes, following a rigorous astronomical campaign: They understand its density, rotation, and size (its diameter is about the height of the Empire State Building). It is known to be a carbon-rich. But the asteroid’s Wikipedia entry is shorter even than that of Asteroids, the arcade game from 1979. Even Bennu’s shape remains a mystery. It appears from telescopes to look vaguely like a walnut, but some screwy surprise could scrap shelves of strategy.

Lauretta has built into the arrival phase of the mission a “regrouping” period, so that the team will have time to step back and take in this entirely new and inscrutable object. This has to be done right. NASA scientists have never before had an opportunity to grab a boxful of the primitive solar system and bring it back home. Conceivably, OSIRIS-REx could rewrite the history of the solar system and help explain the mystery of the origin of life. If the mission fails, it might be decades, if ever, before NASA attempts a repeat. * * * Hours after the Earth gravity assist, the hallways of the Michael Drake Building feel like an Aaron Sorkin movie. Mounted to a wall in the lobby is a digital countdown clock labeled TIME UNTIL EARTH GRAVITY ASSIST. Just after launch last year, it read 374 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, 59.9 seconds. It now reads 000 00 00 00.0. When team members aren’t working, they’re walking and talking or huddled in hallways and doorways discussing the flyby. The images. Prospects and possibilities for the data returned. What might we learn about this third planet from the sun? some joke. Is it habitable? Will there be water? But the spacecraft might indeed return usable earth-science data. The only question presently answerable is whether or not the team will come into the office after midnight and set about studying the data, or wait for more civilized hours of the morning. The scientists seem galvanized by the prospects of doing real science with a real spacecraft and an instrument payload that they conceived and carried to construction. “There is some unknown unknown, some little wrinkle, that is going to show up.” “This is the first opportunity that we’re going to have to really exercise our software that is intended to do mapping,” says Dani DellaGiustina, a senior staff scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “We can use other missions’ data to practice running our software, but the images are a different size, or the images might have different metadata. The cameras are different. This is really the first test of our mapping software that we’re going to have using [the OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite] images.”

DellaGiustina is equally interested in what might go wrong, because better to encounter it now than at Bennu. “The thing I’ve come to realize is that there is some unknown unknown, some little wrinkle, that is going to show up. The more opportunities we have to collect data and push it to our software and look at it, we’re going to uncover some things—about camera behavior, about software, about assumptions in terms of data latency or processing time—that we just hadn’t even thought about.” The Earth-observation campaign will also help Lauretta, Knutson, DellaGiustina, and other mission managers calibrate the team. Though they’ve worked together for years, plans today become operations. Planetary-science missions are notoriously taxing. Once at Bennu, the scientists of OSIRIS-REx will be running operations every day for two years on Bennu time, which does not recognize U.S. holidays or weekends. They will at the same time be publishing papers and reporting results. Such a relentless pace can fracture even the most solid and smoothly polished of teams, which makes today’s maneuver a second launch for the group itself as well as for the spacecraft: For the first time, they will use OSIRIS-REx to study an actual planetary object. (The one on which we live.) The next time they do this will be at Bennu. “You can solve the engineering and you can solve the science, but solving the people is hard,” says Jason Dworkin, the project scientist of OSIRIS-REx out of NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center in Maryland. “You need the right people. You need to feed them the right information. You need to give them the right environment, and leave them alone enough to do their brilliant work. People have different cultures and different ways of getting along.”

OSIRIS-REx has a large travel budget to help with this. “Having lunch together is more important than it sounds,” Dworkin says. “There’s something intimate and primal about sharing a meal that allows you to push through disagreements. Being able to have common jokes. These very human things help us in times of crisis.” * * * The question on everyone’s mind today is whether OSIRIS-REx will get a clear image of our home planet. The camera suite was designed for Bennu, one of the darkest objects in the solar system. (It is about the color of highway asphalt.) The Earth and its swirling white clouds, patchwork continents, and azure oceans might be a bit too much. The whole image might be washed out. This wouldn’t be a disaster from a scientific standpoint, but it would be a huge disappointment for everyone involved. On a spiritual level, that first image is everything. Just after 6:00 that evening, a skeleton group of 15 scientists and engineers gather around the conference room table in the ops room (the “doughnut-distribution center,” where communal pastries are shared every Friday morning over informal conversations that shape the course of space exploration). Among those present are Lauretta, DellaGiustina, Knutson, and Church. Some are seated, some are standing, the anxiety of the moment preventing any real commitment one way or another. After months of planning, you can’t just dial up from your apartment while waiting for your TV dinner. The images are still on the spacecraft, so Church is monitoring its data from her computer—one of a dozen on the table, some open, some closed—and instant messaging her colleagues at Lockheed Martin in Denver for the status of the downlink. (Lockheed runs spacecraft operations. University of Arizona runs the science operations. NASA Goddard unifies and helps coordinate and manage the mission.) Projected on one wall of the ops room is proprietary software that will receive the science data. It should let us know when the image is ready to view.

“We’re on 25 right now,” says Church, drumming her fingers on her laptop. She is referring to the transmitting dish on the Deep-Space Network, NASA’s communications array used to talk with each of its spacecraft scattered throughout the solar system. “California?” asks Lauretta. “Goldstone, yeah.” The room thrums with conversation and undirected energy, everyone sharing inside jokes and old war stories, what it was like receiving the first image from the spacecraft MESSENGER as it orbited Mercury and the first image from Phoenix at Mars. There’s no scientific or professional reason for this assembly: Those present could have connected through secure VPNs at home, or waited until the downlink completed in the predawn hours, or waited until tomorrow for the grand unveiling at a 9:00 a.m. meeting in an auditorium area they call the Pit. But after months of planning, a year of waiting, and a decade-plus of convincing the scientific community and selling NASA, of development and fabrication, of setbacks and scrapped plans and all-nighters and breakthroughs, you can’t just dial up from your apartment while waiting for your TV dinner to be ready. “Okay, it should be coming down,” says Church. Engineering data will arrive first, and afterward, it should take a few minutes for each image to arrive: The spacecraft snapped dozens over a few hours. The energy of the room intensifies, and the scientists discuss camera fields of view and what to expect of this first image. After 13 years of planning, everyone has to know all of this already, but what else can you discuss? The bit counts projected on the wall tick torpidly upward when they tick at all. Church types with a kind of gleeful aggressiveness and takes quick breaths. They exhibit the sort of reverence that causes one to step forward rather than back. The team members break the tension with jokes about colleagues doing Facebook Live (the sort of outreach now part of every NASA mission in recent years) and facetiously ascribe any subsequent personal faults to their newfound Hollywood attitudes. (“Process your images? Yeah right—I’m basking in my likes!”) They discuss Pen-REx, the mission’s stuffed penguin-disguised-as-a-Tyrannosaurus-rex mascot, and how she figures in possible Lockheed motives for slowing the downlink. (“Give us Pen-REx if you want the data!”) “This is the longest five minutes of my life,” Church says.

The image comes without warning despite our having been warned, despite our having been waiting for more than 30 minutes now. It appears first on Church’s laptop, and we know this because she shrieks and laughs.“Oh my god! Wow!” Though it is on her computer, it is not, for whatever reason, on the massive projection at the front of the room, where it should be. Every seat in the room empties as though a fire has broken out, and scientists and engineers fall over themselves to see what she is seeing. There is a unanimous gasp. On her screen is the planet Earth, real and true. Some spontaneously clap, for our home planet and for the team, and the clapping grows to applause. We have to see it on the big screen. This room of engineers—men and women who built a giant space robot with the grace of a hummingbird—are reaching for the HDMI cable to plug it into Church’s computer, and six distinct hands are trying to help, lifting the laptop and guiding the cable and finding the port, and they’re trying to get it attached so we can see it on the big screen. They’re trying to force it into the USB port, and it is gleeful chaos until the technology is at last managed. The HDMI cable is negotiated, and the image isn’t even on the screen yet, and already there is more applause and cheering at this technical triumph, we’re doing this thing, it is happening, and the screen is blue and then, at once, there it is. There was no guarantee that all the work would pay off, and yet there Earth is. “Wow, you guys ...”"
1545151,"San Diego hosts a rare gathering of the nation’s top military leaders.

The Chief of Naval Operations joined the commandants of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard in talking about the future of warfare.

Possible threats to America’s military superiority include rising Russia and China.

A generation of sailors and Marines who waged counterinsurgency wars overseas must adapt quickly to a changed world, where rising powers such as Russia and China threaten to usurp America’s once impervious military.

That was the urgent message delivered Thursday afternoon at San Diego’s convention center during a rare public gathering of three service leaders: Chief of Naval Operations John M. Richardson, Marine Corps commandant Gen. Robert Neller and Coast Guard commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft.

In an hourlong discussion moderated by retired Navy Adm. James G. Stavridis before a packed audience, they described the vital need for a steady funding stream to retrain and rearm services straining from nearly 17 years of constant counter-terror operations.

Hoping to avert another government shutdown, lawmakers on Capitol Hill struggled Thursday to pass a stop-gap spending measure along with a long-term budget that sends $165 billion to the Pentagon over the next two years and increased the federal debt more than $1 trillion.

Over the past decade, Congress paid the military’s bills with a series of continuing resolutions, with fewer funds for the services due to spending caps enacted in 2011’s so-called “sequestration” legislation.

“I’m hopeful that it’ll pass and it’s a lot of money,” Neller said. “But we’re going to get that money like we did last year, with about half the fiscal year left to spend it. That’s not any way to run a business.”

Although both he and Zukunft fretted about the national debt and its economic effects in coming years, Neller said that the influx of military spending was important to preserve the nation’s survival.

“The adversary out there is making big bets, big investments, in their capacity. And their capabilities have grown,” Neller said. “Whether they want to take us on or not, we have to be able to go and display the capability to deter them.”

Richardson said his top priority was revamping the Navy’s ballistic submarine fleet. The underwater Navy carries 70 percent of America’s nuclear warheads.

“Without that strategic deterrent, we’re really in a different world,” said Richardson, a career submariner and the former director of the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program. “Everything becomes impossibly harder. That’s got to succeed.”

Neller said the Navy needs more attack subs, too. The fleet is supposed to deploy 66 of them but today there are only 50 left, a number expected to fall to 43 before shipyards begin churning out two Virginia-class replacements annually in the next decade.

The silent hunters of the deep sail ahead of carrier and amphibious strike groups, sniffing out enemy subs and spying on a foe’s battle fleets.

“We need more attack submarines, OK? I need to get where I’m going,” Neller said.

“When was the last time we had to fight to get to the fight? We just went. We didn’t have to fight to get there,” he continued, pointing to the guerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“We’re going to have to fight to get to the fight.”

Once in the thick of battle, Neller will need newer aircraft, swapping out his aging fleet with fifth-generation jets, tilt-rotor vehicles and high-tech helicopters.

He also wants more reliable and resilient command and control systems. That’s the technology that helps Marines know where their units are in relation to the enemy, clearing the fog of war. The challenge is keeping those networks up while the foe tries to jam, degrade or destroy them.

“We’re trying to create a modern Marine Corps,” Neller said. “The stuff we have we take good care of, but there are Marines over here wrenching on vehicles older than they are.”

Watching an increasingly wealthy Beijing build increasingly sophisticated warships, aircraft and missiles, Richardson said the Pentagon needs to reform the procurement process so that the Navy can more quickly and cheaply deploy vessels.

To contain costs, those ships need smaller crews but can make up the difference with better automated systems, sensors and weapons packing a more powerful punch from longer distances, he added.

They’ll be helped by underwater and aerial drones, plus new directed energy weapons like lasers, he said, but Congress also has mandated a 355-ship Navy.Today he can deploy 280. The problem is America’s industrial base. Shipbuilding capacity today is a third of what the Navy could get in 1955.

“There are 14 shipyards that build ships that shuttered or got out of the defense business,” Richardson said. “So you can see these two conflicting trends — the need to grow the number of ships and yet we just don’t have the industrial capacity to do it.”

Although Zukunft is finally getting the first large icebreaker built for the Coast Guard in four decades, his aging fleet of patrol boats on inland waterways struggles to keep $4.6 trillion in American commerce flowing.

Modern replacements will cost more than $15 million each but the commandant needs them to cost less to maintain and fuel, saving money in the long run.

“Some are 73 years old now,” he said. “It’s not a huge ask but it’s a huge return on investment.”

President Donald Trump is ordering the Pentagon to create the first new US military service branch in seven decades to establish ""American dominance in space,"" and while experts quickly knocked the idea as premature — there`s no doubt that space is a warfighting domain.

As it stands, the Russia and China both have tested missiles that could bring the US to its knees by crippling its satellites.

Satellites power GPS, which powers most civilian navigation and US military equipment. Satellites also time stamp transactions at US stock exchanges. Commercial satellites also relay internet, telephone, and radio communciations. The US, without its space assets, could suffer societal collapse at the hands of its rivals before a single terrestrial battle is fought.

For this reason, experts assess that space absolutely has become a warfighting domain, and one that may soon see lasers on space ships duking it out in a war above the clouds.

How a space war would go down

US Navy ships have already knocked satellites out of the sky. US Navy

""If there was a war between a US and a China, for example, each side would likely try to take away the commanding heights of space from each other,"" Peter W. Singer, a strategist at non-partisan think tank New America and the author of ""Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War,"" told Business Insider.

But instead of starships chasing each other in dogfights and ""Star Wars"" like duels in zero gravity, Singer said that most of a space fight would actually take place on plain old earth, though lasers are on the table.

The US and its adversaries would fire missiles at their adversary`s satellites powering navigation and trade, possibly from traditional land launchers or from ships at sea. The US has plans to streamline the launching of satellites, and hopes any future space attacks can be thwarted by quick, cheap launches of constellations of small satellites.

Singer pointed out that the US has observed Russian ""killer or kamikaze satellites"" maneuvering out in space in ways that suggest they could attack or block US satellites.

""They also might be using directed energy of some kind to either blind or damage a satellite. That directed energy might be laser, ground based or space based,"" said Singer.

The real fighting is still on earth

United State Cyber Command U.S. Air Force/Technical Sgt. Cecilio Ricardo

But much of the fighting wouldn`t be as flashy as space-fired lasers knocking out killer satellites, instead, it would likely take place in a ""cross between space and cyber"" warfare, according to Singer.

US and rival cyber warriors would start ""trying to go after the communication links between space and earth on the ground. They might be trying to jam or take control of the satellites,"" he said.

But therein lies the problem.

Many in Congress have spoken out about the proposed Space Force, calling it premature. The Air Force, in its measured language, seems to hate the idea. Singer called it ""absurd"" and a ""joke."" Retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, also a a former Navy pilot, combat veteran, and four-time space-flyer called it a ""dumb idea.""

Basically, all the jobs the space force would do are already being done by the Air Force, and Navy, so making a costly new service this early into the space age could prove foolish.

""Yea space is a clear part of national security,"" said Singer, ""but it`s hard to imagine a better waste of time energy and budget."""
471468,"Like Banquo`s ghost, the specter of atomic bombs haunted Americans as war raged in Korea and the Soviet Union conducted nuclear tests in Kazakhstan. The fear of nuclear annihilation commingled with allegations that the State Department was riddled with Communist spies. It was 1950.

In preparation for Armageddon, President Harry Truman created by executive order the federal Civil Defense Agency. The president appointed Millard Caldwell as the first head of the U.S. Civilian Defense Administration.

The last Florida governor born in the 19th century and the first to govern in the atomic age, Millard Fillmore Caldwell was ruggedly handsome with an aristocratic countenance. Living a comfortable life as a wealthy lawyer and country gentleman, he never lost an election. A patrician, he wore his conservatism like Roman breastplate but championed progressive education reform. He served as governor of Florida from 1945 to 1949.

Millard Caldwell`s life had already traveled a full arc. He fought in the Great War, and served as a Florida state legislator and a U.S. congressman. Why would he wish to return to Washington, D.C., a place of bittersweet memories? There, his only son was killed in a traffic accident, and he vowed never to return. He later reminisced that he accepted the president`s offer only after playing poker and drinking bourbon and branch water with U.S. Rep. Sam Rayburn and Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson.

Millard Caldwell embodied postwar American attitudes, having become a cold warrior and radioactive anti-communist. Advancing a two-prong approach, he advocated containing communism abroad while preparing for nuclear war at home. ""Civil defense … begins at home"" became a popular slogan.

The agency`s first director became a ""Paul Revere on wheels."" To protect the home front, he asked Congress for funds to build bomb shelters (fallout shelters came later). Caldwell`s disdain for Washington only increased when Congress rejected all funding for shelters. Many members of Congress did not believe that civil defense was a federal matter. Moreover, the price tag was enormous. Civil defense officials even proposed distributing dog tags to schoolchildren, an idea that gobsmacked parents.

Residents of Florida became accustomed to air raid sirens while schoolchildren mastered the art of duck and cover. Civil defense had become an existential and patriotic duty.

Caldwell and President Truman shared many qualities. The two World War I veterans were plain-speaking politicians, often to the point of bluntness. Their families had owned slaves. Truman`s mother refused to sleep in the White House Lincoln bedroom, so scarred were her memories of Union Jayhawkers, guerrilla fighters who often fought with pro-slavery groups from Missouri.

But the president looked to the future, whereas Caldwell could not escape the past. Whereas President Truman supported and promoted civil rights, Caldwell could not and would not adjust his hardened attitudes on race and citizenship.

Caldwell`s philosophy and practices were debated during a contentious congressional hearing in 1951. Critics amassed bulging folders documenting Caldwell`s opinions and actions on the race question. State and national NAACP leaders testified against Caldwell`s appointment, wondering how someone who advocated segregated bomb shelters could serve all Americans. Should questions of race stop at the fallout shelter door?

In 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court had declared white primaries unconstitutional. The white primary prohibited African-Americans from voting in primary elections. In the one-party South, the primary was tantamount to election. Millard Caldwell attacked the court decision as a ""new menace to the independence of the state and … must be resisted with well-directed energy."" He explained, ""I look at the primary as being similar to a club.""

Perhaps most damaging, Caldwell refused to address African-Americans by their surname or title, arguing, ""I reserve the right to address any such person … in such manner as I please, and in accordance with my own views."" Behind doors, congressman Rayburn and Sen. Johnson pocketed votes and provided the embattled nominee cover, winning the day.

But after serving two years as director of the Federal Civil Defense Administration, Caldwell resigned. His tenure had not been professionally or personally satisfying. His views toward race and national defense, largely understood in Florida and the South, incited national anger, criticism and ridicule. The Caldwells returned to Tallahassee and their beloved Harwood, an antebellum plantation.

Throughout the 1950s, Democratic Party officials begged Caldwell to run again for governor or the U.S. Senate. Unrepentant and unbowed, he led conservative Democrats who felt they were fighting a last stand to save Florida from Northern meddlers, federal bureaucrats and a ""namby-pamby cult of no conviction.""

Shortly after the inauguration of Farris Bryant in 1962, the new governor — who pledged to resist integration — appointed Caldwell to serve on the Florida Supreme Court. ""Gov. Caldwell`s conservatism in recent years has been extreme,"" editorialized the St. Petersburg Times. Yet the Times supported the nominee, noting his high standards of integrity.

Justice Caldwell immediately assailed the U.S. Supreme Court`s pandering to ""left-wingers and minorities."" Quoting the Roman historian Tacitus, Caldwell compared 1960s America with the Roman Republic, its citizens ""grown slick and fat, careless of their rights, and fallen prey to ruthless politicians who craved more … power and riches.""

Millard Caldwell provides a cautionary tale as to who belongs on the pedestal. He was once one of the most respected figures in Florida history. In 1967, the Springtime Tallahassee festival debuted, an homage to the Capital City and its first families. Amid the dissonance of the 1960s, a time when it seemed America was spinning apart, Millard Caldwell led the first Springtime Tallahassee parade.

Bedecked as Gen. Andrew Jackson, Caldwell rose his mount in a tribute that would have surely pleased Old Hickory. Indeed, Jackson and Caldwell shared many qualities: Tall and ruggedly handsome, they flashed signs of anger when opponents challenged their honor and character. Frontiersmen and Democrats, their historical reputations have been sullied because of Jackson`s hatred of Indians and defense of slavery, and Caldwell`s racism.

Times change; new heroes emerge and old heroes fade. Andrew Jackson no longer leads Springtime Tallahassee.

But Millard Caldwell is complicated. While he deserves to be admonished for his mean-spirited racism, he should not be relegated to the dustbin of history. Caldwell remains relevant. A patriot and servant, he should not be caricatured as simply a mossback planter. He may have preferred the America of small towns and yeoman farmers, but he also accepted responsibility. He wanted to leave Florida a better place. And he took actions that would shock today`s conservatives.

In March 1945, Gov. Caldwell celebrated the 100th birthday of Florida statehood. An unvarnished conservative, he understood the meaning of conservation. He told Floridians they had an obligation to conserve ""our surface and artesian fresh water supply."" A realist, he demanded reform of Florida`s public schools, reminding Floridians that we should not ""tolerate the false economy of starving services essential to our continued growth.""

2346129,"Saturday is Asteroid Day, an annual, global educational event aimed at learning more about the hazard that nearby asteroids pose to Earth and our civilization, and marshaling support for the search and deflection technologies we need to protect our planet. Many thousands will gather around the world this weekend to hear the latest science on the asteroid hazard, and what we can do to prevent a future damaging impact. (For more visit AsteroidDay.org)

Asteroid Day falls on June 30, the anniversary of the 1908 asteroid impact in Tunguska, Siberia – the largest in recorded human history. That 3 – to 5 – megaton blast above the conifer forest flattened about 800 square miles of trees; a similar airburst today over a modern city would cause severe destruction and death.

The history of impacts on Earth, and our studies of near-Earth asteroids, tells us with certainty that our planet will be struck again – unless we act together to head off hazardous asteroids.

This year’s Asteroid Day is the fourth such global event. The astronauts’ international professional society, the Association of Space Explorers, proposed to the United Nations in 2016 that Asteroid Day be recognized as a global educational event. The General Assembly approved their suggestion later that same year.

Fifty years ago, the first astronauts to orbit and later walk on the moon saw with their own eyes a world blasted with the countless scars – craters – of asteroid and comet impacts.

Such craters are familiar landmarks for my Earth-orbiting colleagues; I saw a dozen or more on my four shuttle missions. These scars show that our world suffers from the same 4.5 – billion – year – old cosmic bombardment process. Geologists now count about 190 craters scattered across continents and seafloors.

A Global Hazard

Protecting Earth from future impacts is a shared responsibility: all of us, in every country, are at risk from this cosmic rain.

The Association of Space Explorers continues to contribute to United Nations discussions of how to find asteroids and prevent an impact. The U.N. even adopted, in 2013, several of our suggestions on how to share asteroid sightings and warnings and make cooperative efforts to test deflection methods.

More importantly, the world’s space agencies, with active NASA leadership, have advanced the science of asteroid detection and the identification of technologies that can nudge a rogue asteroid from its collision path with Earth. These conversations have led to a proposed deflection demonstration mission, called DART, that if funded will slam into a harmless asteroid in 2022 and change its orbital path. The results of that bullet shot, observed by Earth astronomers and a proposed European observer craft, will tell us if we’re ready to use this “kinetic impact” method on a future threatening asteroid. Other methods, like the gravity tractor and directed energy beams, should undergo their own in-space tests, too.

Defending Earth Together

NASA and its partner space agencies have cataloged over 18,000 near–Earth asteroids, and none have yet been found to pose a future threat to Earth. But in the past decade, NASA–funded searches have discovered three small asteroids -- too tiny to reach the ground -- and predicted their harmless incineration in the atmosphere. These impacts were observed by satellites and ground observers (from my perch on the space shuttle, I was fascinated to see meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere below me).

In 2013, a 60–foot asteroid plunged into Earth’s atmosphere without warning over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. The asteroid’s disintegration generated a half-megaton shock wave that blew out windows, damaged roofs, and sent more than a thousand to the hospital. No one was killed.

Chelyabinsk’s unexpected arrival reminded us of the need to increase the pace and sensitivity of our asteroid search. A modest infrared telescope, comparable in cost to a Mars orbiter mission, would find a large fraction of objects, 140 meters and larger, capable of causing regional destruction on our planet. A collision with one of these objects could devastate, for example, Washington, D.C. and five or six surrounding states. Congress directed NASA to perform this search back in 2005 but didn’t provide the funds. We should encourage our representatives to give NASA the funds to fly the proposed NEOCam telescope within the next five years.

NASA also needs the money to build and launch its DART deflection demonstrator craft, aiming to measurably nudge asteroid Didymos – B in October 2022.

Asteroid Day is a reminder to us to nudge lawmakers to fully fund this important test. Because of the worldwide hazard posed by asteroids, I hope NASA will be joined by its partner space agencies in paying for these two planetary defense missions.

The more asteroids we discover, and the more we learn about them (through, for example, the Japanese and U.S. asteroid science missions arriving this summer at two target asteroids), the more rapidly we can employ these objects in our exploration efforts. Water, metals, and even rocks and dust from asteroids can be used to increase the safety of Mars–bound astronauts, lower the mission cost, and grow a vibrant asteroid mining economy in and around the Earth– Moon system.

A Preventable Disaster

We now possess the space technologies needed to identify and stop the threat from dangerous asteroids.

We are slowly building a better ability to find dangerous asteroids, and our computers can project known asteroid orbits a century into the future to predict possible impacts.

NASA and its partner agencies are also planning actual space tests that will show us how to change the orbits of near–Earth asteroids and ensure we can divert those that might have deadly appointments with Earth. But these efforts take money, and in the interests of public safety, we should fund them promptly and fully. (The NEOCam search mission, for example, would total much less than one percent of NASA’s budget over ten years).

We already have many answers to our questions about asteroids. However, the most important one is still unanswered: Do we have the will to act together to defend our planet? If we answer yes, then humanity will survive and spread rapidly across the solar system. If we fail to act, we are certain to suffer the fate of the dinosaurs."
2555907,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday came out with new rules scaling back Obama-era constraints on coal-fired power plants, striking at one of the former administration`s legacy programs to rein in climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency called the Obama-era regulations on coal power plants ""overly prescriptive and burdensome.""

The Trump administration plan broadly increases the leeway given states to decide how and how much to regulate coal power plants. The EPA says it ""empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.""

Combined with the EPA`s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move may actually increase the country`s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump`s ""Dirty Power Plan.""

Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer`s wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. ""Once again, this administration is choosing polluters` profits over public health and safety,"" he said.

Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration`s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

The new proposal establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing any plans to limit climate-changing emissions from power plants. Critics say the new plan would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often and extend the plants` overall operating life, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry. The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country`s power producers to natural gas, wind and solar power, and other less-polluting power sources.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a ""war on coal"" waged by Obama.

""They are continuing to play to their base and following industry`s lead,"" Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed, said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. ""This is all about coal at all costs."""
2396997,"Kentucky-based Charah Solutions, a provider of environmental and maintenance services to the coal and nuclear industries, has set the terms for its initial public offering, just days after President Donald Trump took steps to prop up both energy-sector categories.

Trump last week directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to help failing coal-fired power plants and nuclear facilities by forcing operators of the power grid to buy the electricity that they produce. Most utilities have transitioned to natural gas and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power as those have become cheaper.

Perry said the rate at which coal and nuclear plants are being retired is “alarming” and a threat to the grid’s resilience. Critics have said he is concocting a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.

“Any federal intervention in the market to order customers to buy electricity from specific power plants would be damaging to the markets and therefore costly to consumers,” said PJM Transmission, a group that oversees the power grid in 14 states in the eastern and midwestern states.

Not surprisingly, regulation and climate activism are among the risk factors that Charah cites in its prospectus. The company is planning to sell 7.3 million shares priced at $16 to $18 a pop, to raise $124.1 million at the midpoint of the range. Proceeds of the deal are to be used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes

The company is planning to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CHRA” CHRA, +0.00% .

Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are joint bookrunners on the deal, with Stifel acting as co-manager.

Here are five things to know about Charah Solutions:

It’s highly exposed to coal and nuclear energy

The company is highly exposed to the coal and nuclear industries, to which it provides on-site services that include managing and cleaning up coal-combustion residuals (CCRs), or coal ash. The company has two business segments, environmental solutions and maintenance and technical services, which include outage services and staffing for nuclear-power-generation facilities.

The company said it performed work at 51 coal-fired and nuclear-power sites in 2017.

“We are the only service provider offering a suite of coal ash management and recycling, environmental remediation and outage maintenance services,” reads the prospectus. “We also design and implement solutions for complex environmental projects (such as ash pond closures) and facilitate coal ash recycling through byproduct sales and other beneficial use services.”

The coal and nuclear industries have pressing service needs given environmental demands, the fact that their plants are aging and the types of materials that are needed to power them.

“A decline in the production of CCRs by our coal-fired utility industry customers due to environmental regulations or otherwise could negatively impact our profitability and hinder our growth,” said the prospectus.

Similarly, any decrease in the number of nuclear plants in service in the U.S. poses a risk, as the industry accounts for a “substantial” portion of Charah’s maintenance- and technical-services segment.

“Success by environmental groups in convincing the EPA to restrict beneficial uses of CCRs, or to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste, may have an adverse effect on our business,” the company says.

The existing owners will retain full control

Charah is majority owned by private-equity firm BCP, which acquired a 76% equity stake in the company in January 2017 for $104 million. BCP and its affiliates will continue to hold a 51.4% stake in the company after the IPO is complete. Overall, existing owners will maintain a stake of 75.5%, according to the prospectus, which means they will have the ability to elect all of the members of the board and control management and strategy. They could also be able to block deals that might boost the share price.

It is not allowed to pay dividends

Charah is not just not planning to pay dividends but is strictly barred from doing so by its own debt covenants. Those also bar the company from taking on more debt, issuing preferred stock, buying back stock, making investments, and selling or pledging assets to anything other than interest payments.

For shareholders, that means the only way to make money is through share-price appreciation.

For fiscal 2017, the company had revenue of $430 million and net income of $12.8 million. It has said it is confident that it has a promising market opportunity, citing Energy Information Administration data from 2017 that suggested that coal- and nuclear-power generation will remain indispensable energy sources for decades and provide at least 1.6 trillion kilowatt hours of energy production annually through 2040.

It has had accounting issues in the past

The company has had accounting issues in the past and concedes that it may again.

“We have identified material weaknesses and a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.”

Diversity may not be its strong suit

The Charah board is composed of 14 white men, according to its website. Study after study shows that the more diverse a workforce is, the better for the bottom line.

A recent McKinsey & Co. report, for example, found that companies with more women in upper management are likely to be more profitable. And, conversely, companies with low gender diversity up top are more likely to underperform.

Separately, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that, for profitable companies, increasing the share of female leadership from zero to 30% is associated with a 15% increase in net revenue margin.

Perhaps Charah is wise to that idea; the prospectus lists directors and director nominees to the company’s board, including one woman, former Walmart Inc. executive Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, who is African-American.

2627506,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take emergency steps to keep coal and nuclear power plants running, the White House said Friday, in what would amount to an unprecedented intervention in U.S. power markets.

The White House billed the effort as a way to shore up national energy security, but the announcement triggered swift backlash from an unusual alliance of drillers, renewable energy producers and environmentalists who called it an unfair attempt to prop up non-competitive industries.

“Unfortunately, impending retirements of fuel-secure power facilities are leading to a rapid depletion of a critical part of our nation’s energy mix, and impacting the resilience of our power grid,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement about the measure.

Since campaigning for the White House, Trump has vowed to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry. Both the U.S. coal and nuclear power industries have been shrinking for years, under pressure from cheaper natural gas along with advances in solar and wind energy.

As part of the plan, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) could exercise emergency authority under national security laws to direct the operators to buy electricity from coal and nuclear facilities, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters. (bit.ly/2LPCTp3)

Details of the memo, dated May 29 and circulated ahead of a National Security Council meeting on the subject on Friday, were first reported by Bloomberg News late on Thursday.

Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a major coal-mining state, on Friday praised Trump for carrying out what he said was his idea: “I am glad President Trump and his Administration are considering my idea to use the Defense Production Act to save coal-fired power plants with emissions controls and protect our national security,” Manchin said.

The Defense Production Act, adopted in 1950 at the start of the Korean War, allows the federal government to intervene in business to promote national security.

A coalition of oil, gas, solar, wind and energy efficiency trade groups, however, on Friday released joint statements on the move, calling the proposed action “misguided.”

“We strongly urge the administration to reject this ill-conceived draft plan and adopt a policy approach that promotes market forces and competition in our nation’s power system,” Todd Snitchler, director of market development at the American Petroleum Institute, said.

The administration has said it is concerned the retirement of old coal and nuclear plants could put U.S. power supplies at risk because - unlike solar, wind, and natural gas power facilities - coal and nuclear generators can store fuel on site.

But federal energy regulators have rejected that argument and turned down a proposal late last year from Perry to subsidize nuclear and coal plants for providing “resilience” to the grid.

That did not stop the coal industry from making new requests for help from the administration. In late March, FirstEnergy’s (FE.N) FirstEnergy Solutions [FE.UL] unit - which runs coal and nuclear power units - called on the U.S. energy secretary to use the emergency powers to lift the sectors.

Coal company CEO Robert Murray of Murray Energy [MUYEY.UL], also called for Perry to use emergency powers to save at-risk coal plants.

Analysts said the new plan would face numerous legal and political challenges before it could get implemented.

“While we believe DOE has broad privileges to identify threats to national security, we are skeptical that (the order) entitles DOE to direct power market operators (...) to pay generators more based upon that threat,” said Katie Bays, energy analyst at Height Capital Markets in Washington.

“Litigation would begin almost immediately,” she said.

Earlier this year, east coast grid operator PJM, which serves 65 million customers, published an analysis of recently announced planned deactivations of certain nuclear plants and determined that there was no immediate threat to system reliability. “There is no need for any such drastic action,” said a PJM spokesperson about the new idea."

DRIVING THE DAY

SHANAHAN TALKS SPACE BUDGET: Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan will deliver a keynote address today on the fiscal 2020 national security space budget hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Todd Harrison, the director of the CSIS Aerospace Security Project who will moderate a Q&A with Shanahan, told us he plans to ask about space programs in the budget request, as well the Space Force legislative proposal, an update on the creation of U.S. Space Command and plans for the new Space Development Agency which was formally stood up last week.

Also speaking at the event: Will Roper, assistant Air Force secretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, and Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee.

BRAZIL LAUNCH SITE COULD OPEN FOR U.S. BUSINESS SOON. The U.S. has finalized an agreement that will allow U.S. companies to launch from Brazil’s Alcântara Launch Center, Trump announced Tuesday after a meeting with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. “We won`t go into it now, but because of the location, tremendous amounts of money would be saved. To put it very simply, the flights are a lot shorter,” Trump said. The White House also announced NASA had signed an agreement with the Brazilian Space Agency “to launch a jointly developed satellite in the near future.”

The equatorial location means launches can carry about 30 percent more payload, said David Logsdon, executive director of the CompTIA Space Enterprise Council. The launch site on Brazil`s northern Atlantic coast — the closest to the equator in the world — is best suited for small launch vehicles, though Logsdon said Brazilian officials are considering expanding the site to accommodate larger rockets.

The agreement must still be ratified by the Brazilian congress, where it is expected to face some opposition, said Logsdon, adding that he hopes it will be approved by the end of this year.

INDUSTRY INTEL: Blue Origin adviser urges DOD to keep its options open. Former Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock penned an op-ed this week asking the Pentagon to not go through with plans that would leave it with only two launch providers for national security space missions. ULA, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems and Blue Origin received money in October under the first phase of the Air Force`s Launch Services Agreement contract to begin building a fully American-made rocket. The second phase will select two of the companies next year to complete development of their design and split upcoming Air Force launches.

But Comstock wants the Pentagon to support the development of all three rockets. Funding just two launch providers “would dangerously limit competition and undermine the opportunity to access the full range of extraordinary technological breakthroughs taking place in an incredibly fast-moving commercial space launch market,” she wrote in Defense One.

Shutting companies out of the government marketplace prematurely could also have national security implications, says Greg Autry, a professor at USC’s Marshall School of Business who served on the Trump administration’s NASA transition team. “While the market must and will narrow down to a healthy number of competitors … this isn’t the time for it yet,” Autry said. “If we lock them out, some of these companies are going to [go] elsewhere with their technology and we really don’t want that. China in particular is eagerly snapping up smart U.S. commercial space startups and that is a serious national security threat. Those firms need to believe they have access to governmental launch for NASA, DoD and other agencies.”

Others say delays in development of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket are driving the desire to keep all three companies in the competition. “No one is surprised they’re doing this. The New Glenn is so far behind, they know they don’t stand a chance in phase two so they’re trying to change the rules,” a space industry source tells us, adding that there is concern about whether there aren’t enough government and commercial launches to keep three companies in business.

TOP DOC: NASA releases its detailed budget. The space agency on Monday unveiled details of its $21 billion fiscal 2020 budget proposal, including its funding plans through fiscal 2024. Over the five-year budget plan, investment in deep space exploration systems would grow by more than $2 billion, while investment in the International Space Station and science missions is projected to decrease.

BENNU SURPRISES SCIENTISTS. The NASA mission to the asteroid Bennu has discovered that the space rock ejects plumes of particles from the surface, in what Dante Lauretta, the program’s principal investigator at the University of Arizona, calls “one of the biggest surprises of my scientific career.” Some of the particles zoomed out into space, while others orbited the asteroid before returning to its surface, according to a press release from the space agency.

The surface of the asteroid is also unexpectedly covered with large boulders, forcing scientists to find a smaller site from which to collect a sample of the asteroid that will be returned to Earth in 2023 as part of the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer, or OSIRIS-REx, mission.

Militaries and private companies are developing superfuturistic technologies intended to make troops able to fly around battlefields in automated armored suits.

Jet suits, hoverboards, and miniature drones all seem like fodder for a sci-fi movie, but militaries around the world are looking to employ these technologies.

From enhanced night-vision goggles to motorized body armor, INSIDER found the most futuristic military technology in development – or already on the battlefield.

Militaries and private companies around the world are developing new technologies that turn war fighters into supersoldiers. Jet-powered suits that allow the wearer to hop between boats moving at 20 knots and flying hoverboards are just the start of it.

The Russian military is developing motorized body armor that looks like it belongs on Boba Fett from “Star Wars.” And the hoverboard isn’t just something from “Back to the Future,” it’s a real invention that France’s Franky Zapata successfully used to cross the English Channel this week.

The Russian military, as well as the US, France, and Great Britain, are all developing futuristic technologies that seem like something straight out of a Marvel blockbuster. But these technologies aren’t far off in the future; many are already in testing phases – or in use on the battlefield.

Read on to see some of the most wild futuristic military tech out there.

The French inventor Franky Zapata’s high-flying hoverboard made it all the way to France’s Bastille Day celebrations this year. French President Emmanuel Macron was so enamored that he tweeted a video of it, suggesting that the French military might use them in combat one day.

The idea of warfare in space may seem like a remote possibility, one better imagined occurring on the movie or television screen than in actual reality. However, the fact is that since at least the 1990’s, the idea of warfare conducted from, to, or through space is not only gaining acceptance, but is considered inevitable by a growing number of observers. Indeed, space based warfare is featuring in both emerging military war fighting doctrine as well as in a number of national Law of Armed Conflict Manuals, even if in the latter case it is outlined in very general terms.

Given this growing realization, it is timely to ask what law applies to regulate the conduct of armed conflict in space. The answer to that question is a slightly vexed one. Despite the volume and density of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) in numerous Treaties as well as (re) statements of customary international law, there is a precious little that is said about the application of IHL specifically to space. One notable exception to this paucity is the 1977 ENMOD Convention that does expressly prohibit environmental techniques for changing the ‘dynamics, composition or structure of the Earth … or of outer space’. Beyond this single reference, one would look in vain through the vast body of IHL to find ‘outer space’ mentioned specifically. This then raises the foundational question of whether the general corpus of IHL can apply to outer space, given its lack of mention in the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the Additional Protocols or other key instruments of IHL.

Does IHL Apply to Armed Conflict in Outer Space?

The intuitive answer to that question must be that IHL does apply to armed conflict in outer space. Common Article 1 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions provide that ‘The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances’ (emphasis mine), which surely means the law applies wherever and whenever armed conflict occurs. Moreover, the International Court of Justice determined in the Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion that IHL ‘applies to all forms of warfare and to all kinds of weapons, those of the past, those of the present and those of the future’. The sentiments expressed in that decision have also been reflected in ICJ cases such as the Corfu Channel case and Nicaragua case where the principles underlining IHL have been applied on the basis of ‘elementary considerations of humanity’, even where there was no de jure armed conflict. Hence, given the breadth of expression in Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions coupled with the clear and consistent pattern of application of IHL (or the underlying principles) by the ICJ, it seems an unassailable conclusion that IHL would apply to regulate armed conflict occurring from, to, or through outer space.

Accepting therefore that IHL would apply to armed conflict in outer space, how would it be manifested? Military reliance on satellites is increasing exponentially and is realized in numerous national activities including Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, communications, space situational awareness and early warning ballistic defense. While there are dedicated military satellites, civilian commercial satellites are also used (through contractual means) for military purposes. Given such usefulness and increasing military dependency on space based assets, it is not surprising that there is also being developed a cascading array of specialized weapon systems that can target (enemy) satellites. Such weapons include kinetic anti satellite missiles (ASATs), co-orbital ASATs, directed energy weapons, cyber weapons and electro magnetic pulse weapons. The only weapons system that is prohibited in space are weapons of mass destruction (i.e nuclear weapons) in full orbit. Such prohibition comes not from IHL, but rather is contained in Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty. The US Law of War Manual acknowledges this prohibition and observes, alternatively, that all other weapon systems may lawfully be deployed and, prima facie, used in space.

Assuming armed conflict involving space based assets, the central principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution that underpin IHL would necessarily apply to regulate armed conflict in space. Such principles would also provide necessary protections for civilians and civilian uses of space-based assets to the limits of their application. While such application is well understood in the terrestrial environment, they take on a different complexion in space.

Distinction

The principle of distinction would apply in respect of targeting people and objects in space. Hence, it would necessarily apply to military astronauts engaged in armed conflict in outer space, just as much as it would apply on land, sea or air. One intriguing legal conundrum that arises in this context is the application of the 1968 Astronaut Rescue and Return Agreement, which mandates the return of a foreign astronaut that makes a forced landing outside of their national territory. In the context of a downed enemy military astronaut within the territory of a belligerent country, such astronaut would ordinarily have prisoner of war status under the Third Geneva Convention. However under the 1968 Agreement, he/she is to be returned ‘promptly’ to their home country. No doubt, resolution of this issue would rely on concepts of lex specialis between the two treaty regimes, but which treaty regime would have priority? Perhaps a compromise might be reached where the military astronaut is returned as PW ‘on parole’.

In respect of targeting military objectives (i.e. property) it is well settled that the principle of distinction does not prohibit attacking ‘dual use’ objects. In the space context this would include civilian satellites that are used to acquire and pass on militarily significant information relating to reconnaissance, electronic intelligence, early warning systems, ocean surveillance systems (that can detect surface and subsurface movement), radar calibration and communications. This would also include satellites that provide space based navigational assistance to weapons systems (such as the US GPS). Of course GPS (and the Russian (GLONASS), European (Galileo), Chinese (BeiDou) and Indian (IRNSS) equivalents) also serves fundamental civilian uses, including for example communications, banking, internet, medicine, agriculture, transport and a myriad of other uses that would need to factor in a proportionality assessment. However, prima facie these dual use functions do not automatically render such a satellite protected, if it also serves a military function.

Proportionality

As is well established in IHL, the test of proportionality requires assessment of the possible civilian consequences of an attack upon a lawful target and requires that attacks are prohibited in the following circumstances:

‘An attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated’

There is no set mathematical rule of what is an acceptable civilian loss, though Courts have required than an objective ‘reasonableness’ test be applied. In the space context the issue is less about direct civilian loss, but rather causally connected indirect civilian loss. At present, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) require access to satellite navigational services. Indeed, many of the world’s precision munitions are similarly reliant on global navigation satellite systems. Thus the question would need to be asked as to the military advantage of undermining the enemy’s capacity to use such UAV’s/munitions and whether such destruction would be so great that the loss of something like the US GPS or Russian GLONASS system would be ‘excessive’ to the military advantage anticipated? If not excessive, then they may be lawfully attacked. The resulting civilian loss of global navigation satellite systems would obviously be enormous, however the legal test is not ‘extensive’ loss overall, but rather ‘excessive’ loss to the anticipated military advantage.

Precaution

Finally, is the application of the principle of precaution that requires that an attacking force take all ‘feasible’ precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. The question of precautions in attack has particular relevance in the field of space-based warfare. While physical means of attacking satellites have been proven, the resulting debris created from using a missile or otherwise creating actual physical damage to a satellite, poses a significant problem to safety and continued civilian space use. The laws of physics apply in the context of kinetic attack such that destruction of a satellite and resulting debris doesn`t merely fall to the ground, as is the case of terrestrial warfare, but rather circles the earth at hyper velocity (up to 24,000 kilometres per hour).

Accordingly, military planners would be required to map the projected trajectories of the debris and planned orbits, and possible resulting collisions (the ‘Kessler effect’ referred to in an earlier Intercross post by Brian Weeden), must be taken into account in the military legal planning process. Given these facts, the principle of precaution might mandate that, as a matter of law, kinetic means are not to be used when attacking an enemy military satellite. Rather, there may be a requirement to use cyber means or perhaps a highly specific directed energy weapon to disrupt the function of a satellite without destroying it.

MILAMOS

The MILAMOS (Manual on International Law Applicable to Military Uses of Outer Space) project is a three-year international effort to identify and articulate the law that applies to military uses of outer space. A key component of this project is the specific focus on armed conflict in space. Clearly, in the event of an armed conflict involving space based assets, all civilian protections and priorities as provided for in IHL must apply. This project will ensure that these IHL rules are faithfully recorded and, more challengingly, are given a contextual application. The Project is being led by the University of Adelaide (Australia) and McGill University (Canada) and brings together legal and technical specialists from Governments, the ICRC, Non Government Organizations and academia to discuss and agree on those rules that apply and how they apply. Importantly, the participation of all experts in this project is strictly in a personal capacity and this is designed to optimise the production of an objective, impartial and neutral account of the applicable legal framework. The resulting Manual will take its place alongside other recent manuals that the ICRC has participated in dealing with identifying rules of IHL applicable to naval, air and cyber war contexts. We do live in the ‘age of the manual’ and it is therefore critical that this project be successful so as to enhance the continued sustainability of humankind’s ventures in outer space."
1172232,"When we last left Arthur Everest and his indefatigable crimefighting partner the Tick, they were all abuzz with the tingles of life-threatening danger and possible dissociative fugue. The second part of the series` first season sees the boys getting a much better grip on what`s real - just in time for reality to try and kill them.

Image: Amazon

Amazon`s reboot of The Tick started off slyly ambitious. Its first few episodes kept viewers guessing as to whether the titular character was corporeal or not, as well as giving us an Arthur on the brink of an apparent emotional collapse. Despite the support of his big blue companion, Arthur got overwhelmed by the twists of fate at every turn of his life. The back half of the season, which became available this week, sees Arthur gaining in confidence, while all of the characters growing in poignant and unexpected ways.

The biggest change in episodes 7-12 happens when archvillain the Terror resurfaces, proving Arthur`s suspicion about the not-dead bad guy wasn`t just unresolved childhood trauma. The Terror plans to announce his still-alive-ness with a intricate sinister plot that involves killing alpha-hero Superian. As they try to figure out the dastardly details and gather up allies, Tick and Arthur come to blows with new bad guys and their own issues.

These episodes continue the trend of canny subversion established in The Tick reboot. So Arthur`s escape from the Terror`s lair has funny moments where he doesn`t quite know how to incapacitate the unaware guard he needs to get past. And when his sister Dot demands to be part of the effort to thwart evil, her wish gets fulfilled with no hoary, clichéd objections. These little touches maintain the impression that the series` creative team is winking at an audience that`s all-too-familiar with the genre conventions of a superhero saturated moment.

Meta-awareness informs the Tick`s journey, too. While the big guy still seems blissfully nonplussed about real-world ubiquities such as ride-sharing - ""What`s an Uber?"" - his angst over his unremembered past becomes a major theme. He still knows what he`s here to do, which is punch evil in the schnoz, but the Wild Blue Yonder gets increasingly befuddled as he interacts with more people and things.

Without Arthur, he`s just undirected energy. Arthur, meanwhile, gets a clarity of purpose from the Tick that cuts through all his insecurity and doubt. There`s still wacky stuff aplenty such as mad scientist Dr Karamazov, the Terror`s drum solos, and the massive nakedness of the Very Large Man. But the goofy, tender symbiosis between Tick and Arthur is the epicentre of this series, sending out ripples throughout the rest of the cast. Even grizzled gun-happy vigilante Overkill sees some emotional growth.

The new Tick plainly reminds us that real heroes should care about more than their own messed-up psychologies, a theme that`s emphasised here much more than in previous iterations of Ben Edlund`s creation. They care about each other and about people who need help, which is a welcome reminder in times when the world feels increasingly grim and uncaring. This Tick still has all the one-liners and absurdity that made it a cult favourite, but it also feels more human than ever before.

Episodes 7-12 of The Tick are available now on Amazon Prime Video."
3568420,"As investigators conduct a painstaking probe for the causes of California’s devastating wildfires, conspiracists have spawned their own theory: ignition by a secret cabal of nefarious “internationalists,” including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sergey Brin, who seek to run the world.

“There are hidden powers behind these calculated strikes in California,” warns one YouTube video, titled “An Open Letter To the People of California.”

In Facebook forums, YouTube videos and Reddit threads amassing tens of thousands of views, believers swap manipulated images of “light pillars” from the sky — proof, they say, that rural homes were targeted to burn, forcing residents into cities, where they can be more easily controlled by shadowy forces scheming at oppression.

People have long reached for far-flung theories to explain shocking calamities, such as the mysterious “grassy knoll” assassin of President John F. Kennedy and the U.S. government’s complicity in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.

Psychologists say these theories gain traction during times of trauma because they ease uncertainty, provide a platform for personal grievances and focus blame on an outside group — usually a network of “elites.” Suspicions are cradled by the internet, which allows people who share those thoughts to more easily connect.

“Whether it’s wildfires, contamination of water supply or some ‘deep state’ takeover — all these beliefs satisfy the need to make sense of a threatening and anxious world,” said psychologist Joseph A. Vitriol, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University.

There’s a new high-tech twist to the perceived plots behind California’s recent Paradise, Woolsey and Wine Country fires. Asserting that nature could never incite a fire so fast or hot, some conspiracists say images of the light pillars reveal “directed energy weaponry” that emits highly focused heat. Others say fires were ignited by drones or satellite-based lasers.

While believers are split over the precise contours of the conspiracy, they agree that “geoengineering” is behind California’s parched and flammable landscape. The state’s weather is being deliberately altered, they allege. Then aircraft dump “chemtrails” of drying agents, which are easily ignited. Chemtrails are actually streaks of harmless condensation in the sky.

Who’s behind this complex scheme? Conspiracy websites such as Infowars, run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones, claim it is a secret plot by the moneyed elite to make certain parts of the country off-limits to human use and impose control.

Widely shared maps titled “Wildfires line up EXACTLY in the same path as the California High Speed Rail System” offer evidence, the conspiracists claim, that the fires are a plot to move people out of the way for construction of the transit system, key to eventual state takeover.

(The made-up fire maps’ geography is off, showing that San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento were consumed by flames. Nor does the map line up with the train’s proposed route.)

Critics say social media companies have not stopped conspiracy theories from blossoming on their platforms. YouTube says it is committed to tackling misinformation, Facebook removed accounts that engage in “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” and Reddit banned a subreddit devoted to conspiracy theories, but sites continue to host false narratives about the fires in California.

Meanwhile, teams of highly skilled Cal Fire investigators are scouring the rugged terrain of Butte and Los Angeles counties for scientific clues to the fires — evidence that could someday aid prevention. The truth is climate change and poor forest management set the stage for these disasters, say scientists.

But that hasn’t stopped the theorists.

Former Petaluma fire Captain John Lord, who now lives in Lakeport, called the fires an “unnatural phenomenon.”

“The rate of spread is abnormally fast. … In a normal structural fire, there will always be things that are left — porcelain toilets, tiles, washers and dryers. In these fires, everything is gone,” he said.

“Planes released nanoparticles of metals, such as aluminum, into the atmosphere,” he said. “That is a drying agent, and highly combustible.”

On YouTube, a Paradise resident identified only as Cheryl described seeing “a huge corporate helicopter circling over my house … surveying the town, getting ready to grasp it.”

“The abundance of photographic and video evidence of so-called fire damage to both vehicles and structures in clear and conclusive. These November 2018 wildfires were not responsible for some ofthe most catastrophic destruction,” wrote Michael Thomas, editor of State of the Nation: Alternative News, Analysis and Commentary.

To be sure, some conspiracies turned out to be real. Watergate happened. So did the Iran-Contra affair. Unbelievably, the Russian government meddled in our 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But the creatively conspiratorial, if crazy, theories hold special appeal because fires can be mysterious, said psychology professor David Ludden of Georgia Gwinnett College, who studies conspiracies.

Evacuation orders in parts of Magalia and Concow lifted for residents only “And they fit in with an existing world view that we can’t trust the government, that all these nefarious agencies are out there trying to get us,” he said. Internet sharing “creates a sense of security and superiority, of having inside knowledge that others don’t.”

Such thinking can distract the public from learning the objective reality of wildfires, making it more difficult to reduce risk, said Harvard’s Vitriol.

“It’s not just your crazy uncle in a tin foil hat, ruminating about the government,” he said. If the internet gives these ideas traction, “they spread and gain legitimacy, so they’re harder to combat.”"
207273,"Astronomers have picked up a series of mysterious signals emanating from a tiny dwarf galaxy three billion light years away – and scientists cannot rule out the possibility they were produced by an alien civilization.

Breakthrough Listen, a project dedicated to finding signs of intelligent life in the universe, has detected 15 “fast radio burst” (FRB) signals coming from a mysterious cluster of stars.

The source of the transmissions is called FRB 121102, which is referred to as a “repeater” because it keeps producing the signals.

This rules out the possibility they are produced by catastrophic one off events such as a star exploding.

However, we simply can’t explain the origin of these mysterious pulses.

In a press release, Breakthrough Listen wrote: “Attempts to understand the mechanism that generates FRBs have made this galaxy a target of ongoing monitoring campaigns by instruments across the globe.

“Possible explanations for FRBs range from outbursts from rotating neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields, to more speculative ideas that they are directed energy sources used by extraterrestrial civilizations to power spacecraft.”

If FRBs turn out to be produced by aliens, there’s very little possibility of us contacting them due to the sheer distances involved and the fact that we have picked up the pulses billions of years after they came into being.

“When the recently-detected pulses left their host galaxy our entire Solar System was just 2 billion years old,” Breakthrough Listen added.

“Life on Earth consisted of only single-celled organisms and it would be another billion years before even the simplest multicellular life began to evolve.”

Breakthrough Listen is a global astronomical initiative launched in 2015 by Internet investor and philanthropist Yuri Milner and the British physicist Stephen Hawking."
3990103,"Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said Wednesday that the ""the carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

He said the US carrier fleet — the most powerful naval force — is adapting to meet threats from rivals, such as China, that are openly talking about sinking them.

The admiral emphasized that carriers are hard to kill, calling them the ""most survivable airfield.""

US aircraft carriers are a ""tremendous expression of US national power,"" and that makes them a target for adversarial powers, the US Navy`s top admiral said Wednesday.

""The big thing that is occupying our minds right now is the advent of long-range precision weapons, whether those are land-based ballistic missiles, coastal-defense cruise missiles, you name it,"" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said at the Atlantic Council, adding that the systems wielded by adversaries are ""becoming more capable.""

Chinese media has recently been hyping its ""carrier-killer"" DF-26 ballistic missiles, which are reportedly able to hit targets as far as 3,500 miles away. China released footage of the Chinese military test-firing the missile last month.

The purpose is to send ""a clear message to the US about China`s growing missile capability, and that it can hold at risk US strategic assets, such as carriers and bases,"" Adam Ni, who researches China at Macquarie University in Sydney, recently told the South China Morning Post.

""There`s two sides, an offensive part and a defensive part,"" Richardson said Wednesday, stressing that the Navy`s carriers are adapting to the new threats. ""The advent of some of new technologies, particularly directed energy technologies coupled with the emerging power generation capabilities on carriers, is going to make them a much, much more difficult target to hit.""

Speaking with the crew of the new supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford on Tuesday, Richardson said, ""You are going to be able to host a whole cadre of weapons that right now we can just start to dream about. We`re talking about electric weapons, high energy laser, high-powered microwave [and] very, very capable radars.""

The expensive $13 billion carrier is expected to be deployed in the next few years.

""Rather than expressing the carrier as uniquely vulnerable, I would say it is the most survivable airfield within the field of fire,"" Richardson said Wednesday in response to questions about carrier vulnerability. ""This is an airfield that can move 720 miles a day that has tremendous self-defense capabilities.""

""If you think about the sequence of events that has to emerge to be able to target and hit something that can move that much, and each step in that chain of events can be disrupted from the sensing part all the way back to the homing part, it’s the most survivable airfield in the area,"" he said.

Richardson said the carrier is less vulnerable now than at any time since World War II, when the US Navy was putting carriers in action, and those carriers were in combat taking hits. ""The carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

US carriers are particularly hard, albeit not impossible, to kill.

4377467,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just when it looks like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may restart his ballistic missile testing program, U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed trimming the missile defense budget, as one set of deterrents is delayed by two years.

FILE PHOTO - A flight test of the exercising elements of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is launched by the 30th Space Wing and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency at the Vandenberg AFB, California June 22, 2014. REUTERS/Gene Blevins

The U.S. Missile Defense Agency - charged with developing, testing and fielding a ballistic missile defense system - will delay the expansion of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system by two years because of a delay in the redesign of the Raytheon Co-made “kill vehicle” the system uses.

A “kill vehicle” pops off the top of the defending missile above the Earth’s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile’s warhead.

The GMD is a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles based in Alaska and California, and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS.

The expansion of the field of interceptors in Alaska from 44 ground-based interceptors, or GBIs, to 64 had been slated for completion in 2023. But the delay, due to technical issues and not connected to the cut in the agency’s budget, now means that the placement of the additional 20 interceptors will not be operational until 2025, the MDA said on Tuesday.

“The important thing is to get it right, and if we’re going to build more GBI’s, we want to put the best kill vehicle on the top of it,” said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

At the same time, North Korea has been pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program after a summit meeting between Kim and Trump in Hanoi ended abruptly on Feb. 28 without an agreement on denuclearization.

New activity has been detected at a North Korean ICBM plant, South Korean media said on Thursday, as Trump said he would be “very disappointed” if Pyongyang rebuilt a rocket site.

In the budget, the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, saw its appropriation cut by $1 billion to $9.4 billion.

Michelle Atkinson, chief financial officer of the MDA, told reporters, “What you are seeing in ‘20 actually looks like a decrease, but it’s really just the declining funding,” as the agency comes off recent financial injections.

Trump’s smaller request comes on the heels of a significant budget boost last year after several North Korean missile tests.

The MDA projected a budget of $9.2 billion in 2021, and $9.1 billion in 2022, continuing the trend of declining funding.

One Pentagon-wide effort in lasers that could be used to defeat missiles saw investment slow dramatically. After nearly doubling just the MDA’s budget for directed energy from $109 million in 2018 to $224 million in 2019, the Pentagon as a whole plans to invest only $235 million in the technology in fiscal 2020.

Among other proposals included in a recently published Missile Defense Review is one involving lasers mounted on drones - aimed at stopping missiles just after takeoff in what is called the boost phase.

During this portion of the flight the missile is most vulnerable, flying at its slowest speed, easily detected by the heat from its engines and incapable of evading interceptors as it accelerates to break out of the Earth’s atmosphere."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is set to roll back the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s efforts to slow global warming, the Clean Power Plan that restricts greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.

A plan to be announced Tuesday would give states broad authority to determine how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. The Environmental Protect Agency announced late Monday that acting administrator Andrew Wheeler planned to brief the news media by telephone Tuesday on what the administration is calling the “Affordable Clean Energy” rule — greenhouse guidelines for states to set performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

The plan is also expected to let states relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades, according to a summary of the plan and several people familiar with the full proposal who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the plan publicly.

Combined with a planned rollback of car-mileage standards, the plan represents a significant retreat from Obama-era efforts to fight climate change and would stall an Obama-era push to shift away from coal and toward less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience.

A three-page summary being circulated at the White House focuses on boosting efficiency at coal-fired power plants and allowing states to reduce “wasteful compliance costs” while focusing on improved environmental outcomes. Critics say focusing on improved efficiency would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

The White House rejects that criticism.

“Carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector will continue to fall under this rule, but this will happen legally and with proper respect for the states, unlike” the Clean Power Plan, the summary says. The AP obtained a copy of the summary, which asserts that the Obama-era plan exceeds the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.

Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama.

“This is really a plan to prop up coal plants — or try to,” said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The Trump plan “will make no meaningful reductions” in greenhouse gas emissions “and it probably will make emissions worse,” Doniger said.

Gina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator when the Clean Power Plan was created in 2015, said that based on draft proposals and news reports, she expects the plan will not set specific federal targets for reducing emissions from coal-fired plants. The plan is expected to address power plants individually rather than across the electric grid as the EPA proposed under Obama. The new plan would give utilities and states more flexibility in achieving emissions reductions, but critics say it could harm public health.

‘Truth isn’t truth’: What Rudy Giuliani says he meant “They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” McCarthy said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.”

Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements.

“We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said.

It’s outlined in the National Defense Strategy, why we think it’s a long-term strategic competitor and one that is pursuing a maximization campaign, if you will, throughout the Indo-Pacific Theater, whether it’s politically, economically, or militarily,"" he told Griffin. ""They are clearly professionalizing and expanding the capacity and capabilities of the military in order to push the United States out of that theater.""

“They’ve studied us, and they’ve learned about how we employ weapons; they’ve learned about our doctrine,” Esper added. “And so, that is something that we watch very carefully.”

Esper, a former Army lieutenant colonel, graduated from West Point in 1986 – the same class as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – and spent 10 years on active duty, followed by 11 years in the Army National Guard and Reserve. He brings military, defense and national security experience to the table, and touts a “good relationship” with President Trump.

MARK ESPER SWORN IN AS NEW SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

In his wide-ranging interview, Esper also spoke about deterring Russia’s nuclear ambitions, protecting American elections from foreign hackers, denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and Iran funding its “illicit activities.”

Esper noted what he described as the coming shift from “low-intensity conflict that lasts 18 years,” referring to the war in Afghanistan, to “high-intensity conflicts against competitors such as Russia and China.”

“That means modernizing the force with advanced capabilities, A.I.-based, hypersonics, robotics, directed energy and updating our doctrine -- doing all those things will be critical for us to deter a conflict in the future,” he said.

Esper described China`s theft of intellectual property as a “big, big problem.”

CHINA COULD WIN MILITARY CONFLICT IN INDO-PACIFIC REGION EVEN `BEFORE AMERICA CAN RESPOND,` THINK TANK WARNS

“It’s a state-run organized effort to go after technologies, whether they are defense or non-defense technologies, to go up against other -- all other types of intellectual property, even commercial goods,” he explained. “So, it really requires enforcement. And this is where […] I applaud the president for pushing back against China and all their trade activities that are outside the bounds of what should be expected.”

In addition to safeguarding intellectual property, Esper said the U.S. needs to modernize its nuclear stockpile.

“Our strategic forces are a key deterrent to nuclear war. I think a strong, reliable, capable, ready deterrent is really what prevents nuclear war from happening in the first place,” he pointed out.

PUTIN SAYS RUSSIA `WILL REACT ACCORDINGLY` AFTER US MISSILE TESTS

Esper noted the Russians were “clearly […] trying to expand their strategic nuclear arsenal […] to deal with the United States.”

“And so, as people talk about a New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- that’s why we say, look, if there’s going to be an extension of New START, then we need to make sure we include all of these new weapons that […] Russia is pursuing,” he stressed.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned his country would develop short- and intermediate-range land-launched nuclear missiles if it got word the United States had started building such weapons.

PUTIN THREATENS TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR MISSILES IF UNITED STATES DOES

""Right now,"" Esper said, ""Russia has possible nuclear-tipped […] INF-range cruise missiles facing [Europe] -- that’s not a good thing.”

When it came to Russian hacking, Esper said the U.S. will see “continued malign Russian cyber activity.”

“We will see North Korean cyber activity and Chinese cyber activity,” he went on. “But I will say, we built exquisite capabilities ourselves under Cyber Command. And I think it’s one of the reasons why, between our capabilities and between the authorities granted to us by President Trump in the last year or so, we had little problems with 2018 elections.""

“[We] will continue to apply all of our capabilities and all of our authorities to make sure that we -- our elections -- are protected and that the integrity of our democracy is unquestionable,” Esper noted.

SPACE COMMAND TO LAUNCH AUG. 29 AS TRUMP`S `SPACE FORCE` TAKES SHAPE

The defense secretary also talked about President Trump’s proposed Space Force, and why it was needed – he pointed to nations like Russia and China, “probably more so China,” which are turning space into a “war-fighting domain.”

""Ten years ago, space was a place -- the heavens upon which we looked down upon the Earth and figured out what was going to be the weather in Iowa, or we could survey our adversaries,” he explained.

But, since then, China and Russia have been working to overtake U.S. systems in space and threaten not only the U.S. military but the country’s economy and commerce, as well, Esper said.

“We want to be able to develop a space force that would build the space capabilities in a coherent […] fashion, but, at the same time, have a Space Command that would be responsible for the space war-fight,” he said.

NORTH KOREA`S KIM JONG UN EXPRESSES `GREAT SATISFACTION` OVER LATEST WEAPONS TESTS

The Pentagon chief also told Fox News he applauded the president’s approach to North Korea, saying diplomacy was the way to achieve denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula “in a verifiable, complete, and irreversible way.”

Griffin later asked Esper about former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned from his post in December after disagreeing with the president about the possibility of pulling troops from Syria.

“That was his red line,” Griffin said. “What is your red line?”

“So look, what I said is my issue with any person I ever worked for was, I would never do anything that is either illegal, immoral or unethical. And, I don’t believe the president’s going to ask me to do any one of those three,” Esper said.

Griffin also asked Esper about a moniker in his West Point yearbook.

“In your yearbook, they call you Troop. Why’d they call you Troop?” she asked. Mattis famously had the nicknames “Mad Dog,” “Warrior Wonk” and “Chaos.”

“Because I was really, really committed to military service and being in infantry, and that was kind of a nickname I inherited by a couple friends,” Esper said.

Griffin also asked Esper if anything kept him up at night and referenced claims by Trump that nothing keeps him up at night.

“Is that true for you?” she asked.

“Yes,"" Esper answered. ""Nothing keeps me up at night because I think we’re defended by the best military in history."""
1151945,"Russia and China are developing anti-satellite missiles and other countermeasures that will destroy, damage, or jam low-earth orbit satellites.

The Chinese and the Russians are expected to get this capability within several years.

The Joint Staff intelligence directorate report warned ""this reality should be considered a crisis to be dealt with immediately.""



China and Russia are developing anti-satellite missiles and other weapons and will soon be capable of damaging or destroying all U.S. satellites in low-earth orbit, according to the Pentagon`s Joint Staff.

The Joint Staff intelligence directorate, known as J-2, issued the warning in a recent report on the growing threat of anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons from those states, according to officials familiar with the assessment.

The report concludes that ""China and Russia will be capable of severely disrupting or destroying U.S. satellites in low-earth orbit"" in the next several years, said the officials.

The capability to attack low-earth orbit satellites could be in place by 2020, the officials said.

A Joint Staff spokesman declined to comment, citing a policy of not discussing internal reports.

The J-2 report echoes a similar but less specific warning from Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in May.

""We assess that Russia and China perceive a need to offset any U.S. military advantage derived from military, civil, or commercial space systems and are increasingly considering attacks against satellite systems as part of their future warfare doctrine,"" Coats said. ""Both will continue to pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce U.S. military effectiveness.""

Coats added that both nations are pursuing information operations seeking international agreements that would limit U.S. defenses in space against such weapons.

Russia`s space weapons include a ""diverse suite of capabilities to affect satellites in all orbital regimes,"" Coats testified to Congress, including an airborne laser for use against U.S. satellites.

""Ten years after China intercepted one of its own satellites in low-earth orbit, its ground-launched ASAT missiles might be nearing operational service within the PLA,"" Coats said.

Both China and Russia also are developing debris-removing satellites that Coats said could be used to damage satellites.

Space expert Michael J. Listner said the threat posed by anti-satellite weapons is not new. Both the United States and Soviet Union developed systems to degrade space systems during the Cold War.

""The United States ASAT program, Program 437, took the form of the ASM-135 missile, or the ‘flying tomato can` and was intended by the Reagan administration to be a deterrent to the Soviet co-orbital system,"" said Listner, founder of Space Law & Policy Solutions, a consulting firm.

""When Congress defunded development of the ASM-135 there was no follow-on program to provide the desired deterrent effect,"" Listner said.

""That Russia did not completely scrap its program and China is pursuing its own, leaves the United States with the conundrum of how to deter the threat aside from the hope of resilience.""

Resilience is a term used by the Pentagon for protecting, hardening, or replacing satellites in a future conflict.

Low-earth orbit satellites operate between 100 miles and 1,242 miles above the earth and are used for reconnaissance and earth and ocean observation. Those low-orbiting satellites provide key military data used in preparing battlefields around the world for deploying forces in a conflict or crisis.

Also, weather monitoring and communications satellites, including Iridium, Globalstar, and Orbcomm, circle in low-earth orbit.

A number of critical intelligence and military communications satellites also operate in highly elliptical orbits that during orbit travel in an extremely low perigee close to earth where they will soon be vulnerable to Chinese or Russian attack.

All these low-earth orbit satellites are now highly vulnerable to Chinese or Russian anti-satellite weapons and capabilities.

Those capabilities range from several types of ground-launched space missiles, to lasers and electronic jammers, to small maneuvering satellites that can maneuver, grab, and crush orbiting satellites.

According to a report by the National Institute for Public Policy, as of 2016 there were 780 satellites in low earth orbit operated by 43 nations. At total of 37 highly elliptical orbit satellites will soon be vulnerable to Chinese or Russian ASATs.

""U.S. space systems are among the most fragile and vulnerable assets operated by the U.S. military,"" the report by former Pentagon missile expert Steve Lambakis states.

""This vulnerable communications and data collection, processing, and distribution infrastructure is worth billions of dollars and is vital to nearly every activity of the United States and, increasingly, the armed forces of U.S. allies,"" he stated.

China has deployed two road-mobile ASAT missile systems and is developing two more advanced ground-launched anti-satellite missile systems.

""With this range of direct-ascent ASAT capabilities, China may be capable of using hit-to-kill technologies to target and destroy surveillance satellites in low earth orbit, GPS satellites in medium earth orbit, and early warning satellites in geosynchronous orbit,"" Lambakis said.

""Use of a single nuclear warhead in an ASAT role has the potential to decimate low altitude satellites.""

Beijing also has tested satellites that can maneuver close to satellites in space, a capability that can be used to attack them.

Cyber attacks against satellite control stations also are being developed, along with radio-frequency weapons and directed energy beam weapons.

Russia`s anti-satellite forces have been rapidly built up in recent years, with estimated investments of $5 billion annually, after a lapse in the program after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

Moscow`s space weaponry includes development of a new ground-launch ASAT missile called the Nudol that was tested for the third time in December 2016.

Other weapons include lasers and jammers that can blind or disrupt satellite electronics. Russia also has cyber weapons capable of disrupting satellite control systems on the ground.

Russia`s newer surface-to-air missiles, including the S-300, S-400, and S-500 also are capable of hitting targets in low earth orbit, with the S-500 slated for deployment this year.

For maneuvering killer satellites, Russia in 2014 launched four satellites, including one that was observed maneuvering. The Pentagon suspects that satellite will be used for anti-satellite warfare. Two other of the remaining satellites were detected maneuvering after months of remaining in stationary orbit.

The Russian anti-satellite program also is expected to include an interceptor missile launched from a MiG-31 jet, similar to the now-defunct U.S. ASM-135.

Moscow also has developed high-altitude electro-magnetic pulse weapons that could be used disrupt the electronics of all satellites not hardened against EMP attack.

The Pentagon`s Defense Science Board also warned of the strategic vulnerability of U.S. satellites in a report last March.

The board report said military satellite communications used for global operations, in particular, ""will be contested by a myriad of effects ranging from reversible to destructive.""

""The estimated and projected electronic threats against satellite communication (satcom) have rapidly escalated in the last few years and will continue to increase in the foreseeable future,"" the report, made public in March, said.

""Advances and proliferation in advanced electronic warfare (EW), kinetic, space, and cyber capabilities threaten our ability to maintain information superiority,"" the report said, noting ""under severe stress situations, jamming can render all commercial satcom and most defense Satcom inoperable.""

""This reality should be considered a crisis to be dealt with immediately,"" the board warned."

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Tuesday came out with new rules scaling back Obama-era constraints on coal-fired power plants, striking at one of the former administration’s legacy programs to rein in climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency called the Obama-era regulations on coal power plants “overly prescriptive and burdensome.”

The Trump administration plan broadly increases the leeway given states to decide how and how much to regulate coal power plants. The EPA says it “empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.”

Combined with the EPA’s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move may actually increase the country’s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump’s “Dirty Power Plan.”

Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer’s wildfires and increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already well upon the United States. “Once again, this administration is choosing polluters’ profits over public health and safety,” he said.

Scientists say that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Sen. John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration’s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

The new proposal establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing any plans to limit climate-changing emissions from power plants. Critics say the new plan would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often and extend the plants’ overall operating life, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry. The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country’s power producers to natural gas, wind and solar power, and other less-polluting power sources.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama.

“They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed, said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.”

Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements.

“We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said.

Tuesday’s move opens a public-comment period on the proposal before any final administration action.

Evidence from communications intercepts has pointed to Moscow’s involvement during the investigation involving the FBI, CIA and other agencies, NBC reported, citing three unidentified U.S. officials and two other people briefed on the probe.

The evidence, however, is not conclusive enough for the United States to assign blame publicly to Moscow, according to the NBC report.

FBI and CIA officials did not immediately return a request for comment on the report.

U.S. officials said in July that they are still investigating health problems at the U.S. embassy in Cuba, and do not know who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses, which began in 2016 and have affected 26 Americans.

Symptoms have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said.

The State Department said in June it brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady resembling brain injury.

Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied any involvement or knowledge of what was behind it.

The United States believes sophisticated electromagnetic weapons may have been used on government workers, possibly in conjunction with other technologies, NBC reported.

The U.S. military has been trying to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, including by testing various devices on animals, NBC said, citing Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others.

Part of the work is being done at the directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves, NBC said."

The US Air Force has tested a laser weapon that could eventually arm future fighters, among other aircraft, the service announced Friday.

During the April 23 test, a laser weapon developed as part of the Self-Protect High-Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program shot down multiple air-launched missiles.

The US Air Force successfully shot down multiple missiles with a laser weapon that could eventually defend fighters and other aircraft against existing and emerging missile threats.

The Air Force’s Self-Protect High-Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program is developing a new directed-energy weapon on a pod that could be used to protect US aircraft from surface-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles.

The program recently achieved an important milestone when a ground-based unit eliminated multiple air-launched missiles during testing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force announced Friday.

The Demonstrator Laser Weapon System tested recently appears to be a proof-of-concept testing asset.

The final SHiELD weapon will be smaller, lighter, and more suited to use in a harsher airborne environment, according to the Air Force, and the recent test was a step in the right direction.

“The successful test is a big step ahead for directed energy systems and protection against adversarial threats,” Air Force Research Laboratory commander Maj. Gen. William Cooley said in a statement. “The ability to shoot down missiles with speed of light technology will enable air operation in denied environments.”

Dr. Kelly Hammett, the director of AFRL’s Directed Energy Directorate, said that this capability has the potentially to be a “game changer for our warfighters.”

A Lockheed Martin test pilot recently told an audience that America’s sixth-generation fighter could be armed with directed-energy weapons, according to USNI News. Lockheed is one of three defense contractors involved in the SHiELD program, according to Air Force Magazine.

The Air Force has previously suggested that this system could be used to protect not only advanced fighters but also bombers, tankers, and transport aircraft in high-risk environments, such as the difficult-to-penetrate anti-access zones that US great-power rivals are creating.

Unlike traditional countermeasures, this defensive could offer endless protection against a variety of threats, making it a potentially revolutionary concept. The Air Force is probably still a few years out from demonstrating a working prototype of the final SHiELD laser, The Drive reports."

The Peresvet combat laser, a weapon Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted about earlier this year, has entered experimental combat service with the Russian armed forces.

The laser is said to be able to destroy targets “within fractions of a second,” but Russia has been quiet about what the weapon actually does.

A new Russian laser weapon designed to instantly obliterate targets entered military service over the weekend, the Russian defense ministry revealed.

Russia’s Peresvet laser system, named after the medieval warrior monk Alexander Peresvet, entered experimental combat duty on December 1, the Russian defense ministry’s official Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper reported Wednesday.

The military began taking possession of the first shipments last year as part of Russia’s ongoing military modernization program, according to The Moscow Times, and there is speculation the lasers could shoot down incoming missiles and airplanes.

WATCH: Russia unveils Peresvet laser system

Russian President Vladimir Putin first announced the existence of this new laser weapon in March during his State of the Nation address, during which he briefly introduced the “Combat Laser Complex.”

“We have achieved significant progress in laser weapons,” he boasted, “It is not just a concept or a plan any more. It is not even in the early production stages. Since last year, our troops have been armed with laser weapons.”

“We are one step ahead our rivals,” Putin added without providing any evidence.

Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov offered a bit more information in an interview with Russian state media outlet TASS, explaining that the device could destroy targets “within fractions of a second.”

“We can talk a lot about laser weapons and movies were made about them a long time ago and fantastic books have been written, and everyone knows about this,” he introduced. “But, the fact that these systems have started entering service is indeed a today’s reality.”

The Russian defense ministry posted a video of the weapon back in July, before it had officially entered service.

Not much is publicly known about the Peresvet combat laser system, as Sputnik, a Russian media outlet controlled by the government, noted. What exactly it does has been the subject of much speculation.

“It is expected to be an air-defense system that can track and shoot down hostile aircraft and missiles,” Sputnik explained, adding, “Some suggest it will be tasked with ‘blinding’ sophisticated enemy systems, making them inoperable.”

Other countries, like the US and China, are also developing directed energy platforms.

China unveiled the LW-30, a vehicle-based laser weapon built to quickly eliminate a variety of aerial targets, at Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai last month.

Experts speculated that the weapon designed by China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) could be deployed to the South China Sea."

Transcript, via Hugh Hewitt Show:













HUGH HEWITT, HOST: I’m joined by my friend, Congressman Tim Ryan from the great state of Ohio, from Niles and Warren, in fact. Congressman, are you in The Land? Or are you back inside the Beltway…uh oh, Congressman Ryan, are you on…



REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): I’m in The Land.



HH: Oh, good. You should be back here. Don’t you have first day at work tomorrow?



TR: Yeah, I’ll be there tonight late.



HH: All right. First question, Ohio State last night, you’ve got to say they should have been in the Final Four, don’t you think?



TR: There’s no doubt about it, no doubt about it. I mean, you know, when you watch even the Georgia game and how they played last night, you think Ohio State’s got to be there. I think they need to move to a bigger tournament. They need to move to at least an 8-team playoff.



HH: That is, they just got screwed, and they looked good last night. They laid off a little bit in the second half, but they still looked good. And the Browns, Congressman, I have to think this is the first time you and I have felt optimistic about our club in a long time.



TR: Unbelievable. I mean, Baker, Baker, Money Maker. I’m so pumped. I mean, it feels like I’ve got another day in the week back with my Sundays now, so it’s unbelievable.



HH: There you go. There you go. So that’s next year. Let’s talk about this year. Are you and Nancy Pelosi getting along after your challenge to her speakership a few years ago?



TR: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we get along fine. You know, a lot, we kept it professional the entire way. I mean, I clearly had some opinions that I expressed numerous times publicly, but you know, at some point, you’ve got to start governing the country. And we’re in the majority now in the House.



HH: Now I want to tell people you are on the House Appropriations Committee. More importantly, not only are you in House Appropriations, you’re on the Defense subcommittee. Two years ago, we approved $700 billion dollars in spending, last year $716. The President’s request is going to be $750. Tim Ryan, this is your number one job to get this right. Do you think we’ll get an appropriations bill out of the House that’s near the President’s request and over to the Senate?



TR: I hope so. I think we will. I mean, we’ve got to make the bigger argument, and here’s the problem I see, Hugh, with the 24 hour news cycle that the President gets himself wrapped up in, the constant back and forth, the chaos. We’re losing the larger narrative of our relationship in the world with our allies, our relationship in the world with China, and our relationship with Russia. China is coming at us. They are in Africa. They are locking down long-term deals in Africa for raw materials. They’re building islands in the South China Sea. They’ve got very detailed, long-term programs like their One Belt, One Road, where they’re connecting Asia to the Middle East. They’ve got a Make It In China 2025, where they’re really trying to take over manufacturing in the world. They’re investing hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, wind, solar, high-speed rail. And we aren’t even acting like we’re in a competition with them. And the Defense budget with the technologies that are in there, and look, we’ve got to audit the Defense Department. We’ve got to make sure we’re not wasting money. But we are falling behind in major technologies in weapons systems that we can’t afford to fall back on.



HH: Well, that’s music to my ears. Do your colleagues on the Democratic side, because you’ll be in the majority now, do they agree with you on Approps? And will they agree with you in Rules? And will it get to the floor and get to the Senate?



TR: Well, we’re going to find out. You know, we’ve got a pretty diverse coalition in the Democratic caucus right now. But again, you know, we have got to make sure every member of the Democratic caucus and the country understand this competition. And if you’re in this competition, and China is overtaking us in so many ways, Russia doesn’t have quite as strong of an economic hand as China does, but they are playing their hand pretty well, militarily. And we’ve got to compete with them as well. If you don’t understand that competition, you’re not going to understand the need. One of the provisions we’ve got to continue to push, too, Hugh, is when we’re making things through the Defense Department, when we’re signing these big contracts, that this stuff is made in the United States, that this stuff is made in areas that have lost manufacturing so that the tax dollars aren’t just serving a great national purpose with our Defense industry and our foreign policy and hard and soft power, but it’s also creating jobs in areas that need job creation to happen.



HH: Now you know, the Chinese are putting one ship in the water every single month. We’re not even close to that. Do you think that you’re going to get, do you think the acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan being an acquisition guy is going to figure out how to lay out for the House a detailed set of acquisition instructions?



TR: I hope so. You know, I think really all my disagreements with what’s happening with the government today, I think Secretary Mattis put together really the only comprehensive long-term plan for acquisition, technology, and readiness within, and creating a lethal force within the National Defense Strategy. It is comprehensive. It is detailed. I hope we just continue to execute what he’s put forward, him and his team have put forward, and that includes acquisition. And this is another reason, too, Hugh, I mean, we don’t have to build every sub if we have allies that have submarines, too. And so people say well, what the hell do we need to be friends with this country or that country. Well, if you peel the onion back one layer, you realize well, they’ve got five submarines and they help us in Iraq, and they help us in Syria, and they help us here and they help us there. Those are costs and expenses we don’t have to incur, because we have friends. And so yeah, we’ve got to build more submarines, because we are falling behind. But we also have to make sure we keep those relationships with our allies, because we utilize their material and their weapon systems, too.



HH: All right, last question on this. I don’t think of China as a friend, and I don’t think of them as a near-peer competitor. I think of them as a peer competitor that has not taken military action off the table, nor will they ever. Do you agree with my assessment, Tim Ryan?



TR: I sure do. I sure do.



HH: That puts you in the part of the Democratic Party that I remember as the Scoop Jackson Democrats. When are you going to Iowa next, Congressman Ryan?



TR: (laughing) I don’t have any trips planned to Iowa or New Hampshire, but I am getting invited a lot to those two states. So I may end up making another road trip.



HH: Do you have any plans on making an announcement on seeking the presidency?



TR: I’m going to make a decision in the coming weeks. Yeah, I’m going to…



HH: You’re going to do that on this show, I assume?



TR: Oh, well, of course.



HH: Of course.



TR: (laughing)



HH: You know, California starts voting absentee the same day that the Iowa Caucuses happen, and it votes for 30 straight days, and it’s millions of votes. I’m on in every major market in California. I’m sure curious what do Democrats do about this situation if they’re thinking about the presidency?



TR: Well, I mean, look, this is politics. These are elections. You start and you win. I mean, that, to me, is how you get elected. I mean, it’s not brain surgery. You get elected. If a candidate pops in Iowa, it’s certainly going to help them the next 30 days in the California early vote. And if you can get over to New Hampshire and get another win and get a lot of momentum, that’s going to help you as well. But if looks like from the rumors that there may be two, three, maybe even four different candidates from California, which will divide up the California vote and you know, so that would make anybody eligible to maybe pull something off over there. So it’s complicated, but there, those four early states are going to be key for anybody, especially somebody like me who would come out. I’m not from New York. I’m not going to have all the money or the power centers in the country. So it’s imperative for an outsider candidate to win Iowa and New Hampshire and then keep going.



HH: Is it okay to call you a Scoop Jackson Democrat? Does that, is that okay in your party anymore, or do you have to run from that title?



TR: I don’t know if anybody remembers Scoop Jackson, but you can. You know, again, I think, like you can’t participate in a global economy without a strong military. It just doesn’t make any sense. And if you know, Democrats need to make sure that on these issues of security, whether it’s securing the border or securing our national defense and protecting our interests around the world, especially you know, when it comes to climate, we’ve got to be engaged. And you know, you can’t do that without a strong military.



HH: Let me turn to two local issues. Number one, Lordstown, they took $50 billion dollars in federal aid. You and I both grew up with people who were working on the line or had kids in our school when they were working on, our teachers would work there in the summertime. That’s a death blow to the Valley. What do you hear from GM?



TR: I’ve got to tell you, Hugh, it has been devastating. I mean, you grew up not far from where I grew up in the same county. And to watch these families now leave, you know, we hear about family separation at the border. Well, there’s family separation happening right now in Trumbull County, Ohio, where the dad or the mom has to leave the family to go to Tennessee or go to Arlington, Texas, or go, and they’re literally going to commute and leave the family, because the kids are in high school, and they’re established, and it’s sickening what’s happening. I don’t know what GM’s going to do. I had several conversations with Mary Barra. But this is all coming down to contract negotiations, you know, with the local unions from around the country. And then they’re going to figure out from those contract negotiations which product goes where. And we’re hoping that Lordstown, Ohio is in the mix. What makes you sick, too, look, they got the bailout, right? They got the rescue package which I voted for and supported. And then they got $157 million dollars this past year in the tax cut. And then they cut 14,000 jobs and their stock goes up 6%. Now what’s wrong with that economic model there?



HH: There’s a lot. And I’ll tell you, when you take government money, you don’t do that. If it’s a private company without government money, it’s fine by me. But that is just a pure, that’s a private-public partnership that ought not to screw Ohio. Last question, Ravenna. The missile defense agency is going to have to decide someday about the East Coast missile defense system. And if they put it in Ravenna, that makes sense to me. What do you hear, Tim Ryan?



TR: I haven’t heard much. They’re, they keep delaying the decision. I’m not sure they’re going to keep the program. It, Mattis said he wanted it to go back for further review. This was several months ago. We feel like we have the best option here for the East Coast missile defense fund. Again, this is what I mentioned earlier about spending Defense money in areas that would really benefit to have $3-4 billion dollars in economic impact and 800 full-time jobs when it was all said and done in a region in Northeast Ohio that could really use it. That’s how you want to be spending your Defense money. It meets a national purpose, national Defense purpose, but also has economic impact. I hope that happens. We haven’t heard. Maybe with the new secretary now, we’ll get some word. But I’m hoping we move forward with it, not just to authorize the program, but to fund the program.



HH: You kown, Dr. Griffin, who’s the chief technology officer at the Pentagon, said at CSIS a couple weeks ago, “I think everybody is aware that the last time we really invested in transformative capabilities was in the Reagan era. We introduced stealth fighters, stealth aircraft. We introduced GPS precision-guided munitions, high-data encrypted communications, things that were really transformative.” We’ve got to get back in that game. I think it starts in Ravenna, because we’ve got to be ready to intercept this stuff – hypersonics and all of them.



TR: Yeah, no question about it. I mean, directed energy, there’s a lot of technologies that we’re behind on, and we’ve got to make investments in. And like I said, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, I think most people want to see that those products are being built and assembled and manned and fixed in the United States to the extent we can do that.



HH: Amen. Amen. All right, well, you’re a Scoop Jackson Democrat to me, Tim Ryan, and you’re a Browns and a Buckeye fan, so have a great start to 2019. I’ll see you inside the Beltway.



TR: You, too. Take care, Hugh. Thanks.



HH: Thank you."
1592877,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported fourth-quarter results ahead of Wall Street expectations Monday and gave strong profit guidance.

X Excluding a one-time $1.9 billion charge due to the new tax act, earnings jumped 32% to $4.30 per share while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $4.06 a share on revenue of $14.75 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.

Lockheed sees 2018 earnings of $15.20-$15.50 a share and revenue of $50 billion to $51.5 billion vs. analyst consensus for earnings of $14 a share on sales of $51.53 billion.

Lockheed shares closed up 1.9% to a new high of 351.42 on the stock market today. Boeing (BA), which reports Wednesday, slipped 0.7% to 340.82.

Aeronautics unit sales rose 11.8% to $6.04 billion on increased production of the F-35 and deliveries of the C-130 as profit margins widened by 20%. The F-35, the costliest procurement program in Defense Department history, is seeing faster rates of production, and Lockheed met its delivery target last year despite Pentagon warnings that the company would fall short.

But the aircraft`s performance after it comes off the assembly line has come under scrutiny. A recent report from the Pentagon`s top weapons tester found that efforts to improve the F-35`s reliability are ""stagnant,"" according to Bloomberg.

But Lockheed later defended the program, saying that reliability of the F-35`s weapons systems has been improving over successive production lots, with newer jets averaging more than 60% availability.

Bloomberg also reported that Lockheed is asking the Pentagon for $212 million for restructuring costs for its acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, claiming it will save taxpayers money.

Missile and fire control unit sales jumped 30.5% to $2.29 billion on increased air and missile defense deliveries, but space systems unit sales fell 12% to $2.45 billion on fewer government satellite launches.

When asked if some of the tax cut savings could be spent on R&D for efforts to develop a boost phase missile defense — shooting down a missile during the ascent phase — during the conference call, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said that spending on R&D ""would be right in line for our customers.""

Missile defense was highlighted as a priority in Washington`s National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy and Hewson touted a recent test pairing the company`s Aegis defense system with the F-35 to spot targets sooner. She also mentioned investments in hypersonics and directed energy R&D.

IBD`S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here`s an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.

Rotary and mission systems sales climbed 14% to $4.35 billion. But Lockheed still expects a muted year for commercial helicopters. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said oil and gas will have to stay at $65 per barrel for longer before there will be ramp up in commercial sales.

""We`re not expecting large increase in commercial helicopters in 2018 and looking flat in 2019,"" he said during the company`s conference call. ""But that could change pretty quickly based on oil and gas prices.""

Lockheed also said it plans to invest $5 billion in its pension plans to pre-pay through 2021 to see a $1 billion benefit under a new accounting standard.

Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped fourth-quarter profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue while Northrop beat.

Northrop also lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance. Raytheon and General Dynamics said orders and backlogs were strong.

1148305,"Ever since the Air Force announced the development of the AC-130J Ghostrider to replace older generations of Lockheed Martin’s reliable fixed-wing gunship, Air Force Special Operations Command just can’t seem to resist slapping more guns on the thing.

In 2015, AFSOC added a 105mm cannon — basically a fucking howitzer normally reserved for armored ground vehicles — to the rear of the vessel at the insistence of former chief Lt. Gen. Bradley Heithold, supplementing the AC-130’s current arsenal of AGM-176A Griffin missiles, GBU-30 bombs, and a pre-existing 30mm cannon — making the gunship the most heavily armed in the Pentagon’s arsenal.

“We’ve got a bomb truck with guns on it now,” Heithold told Air Force Times in 2015, dubbing the Ghostrider “the ultimate battle plane.”

While AFSOC only got its hands on its first AC-130J gunship in October 2016, flown from Hurlburt Field to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida to test out that brutal 105mm cannon, Air Force officials are most excited about the Ghostrider’s other big gun: a frickin’ laser beam.

While the use of high-powered lasers to knock out enemy electronics and destroy infrastructure was always part of the mix in the Ghostrider’s development, a new report from National Defense magazine says the “directed energy weapon” is “rapidly moving” from science fiction to practical integration with an aircraft at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. AFSOC officials are amped. From National Defense:

Using a high-energy laser, he aims and shoots at an electrical transformer, the engine of a pick-up truck, communication equipment stacked near the compound’s front door, and a drone sitting in the courtyard.

“Without the slightest bang, whoosh, thump, explosion, or even aircraft engine hum, four key targets are permanently disabled. The enemy has no communications, no escape vehicle, no electrical power and no retaliatory” intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability, said Lt. Gen. Brad Webb, commander of Air Force Special Operations Command, as he relayed the story.

“Minutes later, the team emerges from the compound, terrorist mastermind in hand. A successful raid,” he said.

“We’re no longer talking about bulky chemical lasers, but streamlined electrical lasers,” Webb told National Defense. “These pioneering scientists have honed the ability to combine smaller lasers into a finely-tuned, exquisite single laser. Beam control seems to no longer be an issue. Nor is the cooling technology needed … to keep the system operating.”

According to Air Force Times, Heithold initially proposed lasers as a countermeasure to enemy missiles, a defensive measure in place of the powerful 105mm cannon. But the idea eventually evolved into an offensive system capable of silently disabling enemy vehicles or infrastructure without firing a shot.

“The technology is ripe for doing this,” Heithold told the Air Force Association’s conference in September. “I’ve got the space, I’ve got the weight, and I’ve got the power.”

AFSOC hopes to see a combat operational AC-130J gunships by fiscal year 2018, with a fleet of 37 Ghostriders ready to bring the pain by 2020. But until then, AFSOC has a significant amount of testing to do: reducing vibrations to ensure a tight beam (!!!), integrating the weapons platform into an aircraft’s electrical systems, even just creating a “window” in the craft body from which a laser beam can actually shoot.

And beyond operational testing, funding challenges remain. Heithold, who left AFSOC in 2016, told National Defense that the Pentagon wants to invest $3.4 billion in directed-energy weapons across the entire DoD, and that the biggest roadblocks to a combat implementation might be the lack of a clear developmental roadmap (or, as usual, bickering).

But despite these potential obstacles, those who have seen the awesome power of the AC-130J Ghostrider are excited to see the gunship, bristling with firepower and futuristic weaponry, terrify enemies downrange sooner rather than later.

“Believe me,” Webb told National Defense, “this technology is quickly leaving the pages of science fiction.”"
2285574,"(CNN) US President Donald Trump`s mooted Space Force, which he suggested will be a ""separate but equal"" branch of the military, is vital to maintaining a tactical advantage over geopolitical adversaries, according to analysts and members of the US military.

Speaking at a space policy event at the White House Monday, Trump insisted that ""we must have American dominance in space,"" and announced he is ""directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish the Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.""

""We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force,"" he said. ""Separate but equal, it is going to be something so important.""

Space, he said, is ""going to be important monetarily and militarily. We don`t want China and Russia and other countries leading us. We`ve always led -- we`ve gone way far afield for decades now.""

The creation of a militarized space force is by no means a new concept. In the US, the development of an advanced space program has been a critical element of national security since the Eisenhower administration.

This process was accelerated during the Cold War, following the rapid expansion of the Soviet Union`s own satellite and space programs.

Today, the United States is among a number of countries to maintain an advanced space program, utilizing technologies such as navigation satellites for military purposes.

Speaking to CNN, Military Analyst US Lt. Col. Rick Francona (ret.) said that most US military leaders understand that the United States needs to be the dominant force in space in order to maintain its competitive edge.

""I hate the term `the final frontier` but (space) is the ultimate high ground. Space doesn`t dominate one small geographic area -- it dominates continents, oceans,"" said Francona.

""Most military thinkers know this is the battle space of the future.""

In 1967, the US joined the Soviet Union in signing the Outer Space Treaty, an international set of agreements meant to prevent weapons of mass destruction from being placed in space.

What shape Trump`s Space Force will eventually take currently remains unclear, though any serious attempts to place weaponized systems into space will likely prove prove contentious.

""The US military relies heavily on space based operations, including communications, command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and all facets of operations,"" said Francona.

""It`s essential (for US interests) that the US military has not only access to, but dominance of space.""

Space race

Following remarks made in May by Trump, US Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican congressman who has long advocated for the inclusion of a separate branch of the military to defend American interests and defenses in space, told CNN that ""Russia and China are surpassing us in space capabilities and we need to dedicate a separate force solely with a space mission.

""The future of war will be fought in space, and we must stay diligent and ahead of other countries for our own national security.""

There is some cause for urgency. Putin has boasted of Russian development of a hypersonic glide vehicle that can be launched into space, navigate on its own into Earth`s atmosphere and avoid radar and antimissile defenses.

Similarly, while Chinese officials have always stressed the country`s ""peaceful motives"" behind its space exploration and utilization China has developed and tested anti-satellite and antiballistic missile weapons, that analysts say could disrupt and destroy most US communication satellites.

A 2015 report prepared by the US Department of Defense suggested China was developing co-orbital anti-satellite systems to target US space assets.

""These systems consist of a satellite armed with a weapon such as an explosive charge, fragmentation device, kinetic energy weapon, laser, radio frequency weapon, jammer, or robotic arm,"" read the report

Responding to a question from CNN regarding Trump`s announcement Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said that ""Outer space is an asset shared by all mankind. China always advocates the peaceful use of outer space, and opposes the weaponization of outer space and space arms races.""

Asked whether the formation of the the US Space Force could spark a renewed space race, Geng said that China was ""even more opposed to treating outer space as a battleground. We hope all sides will make a joint effort to earnestly preserve lasting peace and calm in outer space.""

Technological developments

At present, space weaponry broadly falls into three categories.

""Weapons from the ground that attack spaceborne assets, (such as) lasers to blind and interfere with satellites` guidance; weapons in space that attack other assets in space; and space borne weapons attacking targets on earth,"" said Francona.

According to Francona, there are only three powers capable of operating a space-based military presence: Russia, China and the US.

""Both Russia and China have acknowledged they are developing -- or have developed -- counter-space capabilities,"" US Navy Adm. Cecil D. Haney said in 2015

""Both countries have advanced directed energy capabilities that could be used to track or blind satellites, disrupting key operations, and both have demonstrated the ability to perform complex maneuvers in space.""

While the US was the first country to develop anti-satellite technology, back in the Kennedy era, much of this technology has fallen by the wayside, given an assumed dominance of space, said Brian Weeden, Technical Adviser for the Secure World Foundation, which promotes cooperative solutions for space sustainability and the peaceful uses of outer space.

Similarly, Russia`s programs atrophied at the end of the cold war but there`s now ""evidence that they`re reconstituting them, and China is building its space capabilities, both offensive and defensive (from) reconnaissance satellites, communication satellites (and) evidence that it`s building ground launched anti-satellite missiles,"" said Weeden.

JUST WATCHED Meet the US military`s sentry for space Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Meet the US military`s sentry for space 02:05

Currently the US` space operations are largely in a defensive posture, said Weeden, but with Chinese and Russian developments in the field some advocates of a stronger military presence, like US Rep. Mike Rogers, have argued that this may need to change.

Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, has also said the US needs to embrace a new policy and make it clear that if command and control or warning satellites are targeted, the US ""would consider that to be a hostile act"" and respond.

""It`s probably time as a country that we start to talk about this,"" said Wilson."

2058664,"The administration of US President Donald Trump has proposed new rules that would scale back limits on coal-fired power plants, a move critics said would have dire environmental and health consequences.

The proposal, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday, would broadly increase the leeway given to states to decide how much to regulate coal power plants.

The EPA said it ""empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation.""

Tuesday`s proposal is the latest move by the current administration to roll back environmental protections put in place by Trump`s predecessor, President Barack Obama.

Combined with the EPA`s proposal earlier this month to ease mileage requirements for vehicles, the move could increase the country`s climate-changing emissions, according to some former top EPA officials, environmental groups, and other opponents.

The Natural Resources Defense Council called the replacement proposal Trump`s ""Dirty Power Plan"".

Democratic Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey cited this summer`s wildfires, increasing droughts and coastal flooding as evidence that man-made climate change from burning coal and other fossil fuels is already happening.

""Once again, this administration is choosing polluters` profits over public health and safety,"" he said.

Scientists said that without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme events such as storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.

In a statement, Republican Senator John Barrasso from the coal state of Wyoming welcomed the overhaul of the Obama administration`s 2015 regulations, called the Clean Power Plan.

`Reviving the coal industry`

Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia, a top coal-producing state, on Tuesday.

Trump has already vowed to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

The Obama administration had worked to nudge the country`s power producers towards less-polluting energy from natural gas, wind and solar power, among others.

Meanwhile, Trump also directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of ""fuel-secure"" power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation`s power grid and reducing its resilience.

Obama`s plan was designed to cut US carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

The Supreme Court put Obama`s plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

The Trump administration is emphasizing ""coal at all costs,"" said Gina McCarthy, EPA administrator when the Obama plan was developed.

""They are continuing to play to their base and following industry`s lead,"" she said.

1545172,"San Diego hosts a rare gathering of the nation’s top military leaders.

The Chief of Naval Operations joined the commandants of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard in talking about the future of warfare.

Possible threats to America’s military superiority include rising Russia and China.

A generation of sailors and Marines who waged counterinsurgency wars overseas must adapt quickly to a changed world, where rising powers such as Russia and China threaten to usurp America’s once impervious military.

That was the urgent message delivered Thursday afternoon at San Diego’s convention center during a rare public gathering of three service leaders: Chief of Naval Operations John M. Richardson, Marine Corps commandant Gen. Robert Neller and Coast Guard commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft.

In an hourlong discussion moderated by retired Navy Adm. James G. Stavridis before a packed audience, they described the vital need for a steady funding stream to retrain and rearm services straining from nearly 17 years of constant counter-terror operations.

Hoping to avert another government shutdown, lawmakers on Capitol Hill struggled Thursday to pass a stop-gap spending measure along with a long-term budget that sends $165 billion to the Pentagon over the next two years and increased the federal debt more than $1 trillion.

Over the past decade, Congress paid the military’s bills with a series of continuing resolutions, with fewer funds for the services due to spending caps enacted in 2011’s so-called “sequestration” legislation.

“I’m hopeful that it’ll pass and it’s a lot of money,” Neller said. “But we’re going to get that money like we did last year, with about half the fiscal year left to spend it. That’s not any way to run a business.”

Although both he and Zukunft fretted about the national debt and its economic effects in coming years, Neller said that the influx of military spending was important to preserve the nation’s survival.

“The adversary out there is making big bets, big investments, in their capacity. And their capabilities have grown,” Neller said. “Whether they want to take us on or not, we have to be able to go and display the capability to deter them.”

Richardson said his top priority was revamping the Navy’s ballistic submarine fleet. The underwater Navy carries 70 percent of America’s nuclear warheads.

“Without that strategic deterrent, we’re really in a different world,” said Richardson, a career submariner and the former director of the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program. “Everything becomes impossibly harder. That’s got to succeed.”

Neller said the Navy needs more attack subs, too. The fleet is supposed to deploy 66 of them but today there are only 50 left, a number expected to fall to 43 before shipyards begin churning out two Virginia-class replacements annually in the next decade.

The silent hunters of the deep sail ahead of carrier and amphibious strike groups, sniffing out enemy subs and spying on a foe’s battle fleets.

“We need more attack submarines, OK? I need to get where I’m going,” Neller said.

“When was the last time we had to fight to get to the fight? We just went. We didn’t have to fight to get there,” he continued, pointing to the guerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“We’re going to have to fight to get to the fight.”

Once in the thick of battle, Neller will need newer aircraft, swapping out his aging fleet with fifth-generation jets, tilt-rotor vehicles and high-tech helicopters.

He also wants more reliable and resilient command and control systems. That’s the technology that helps Marines know where their units are in relation to the enemy, clearing the fog of war. The challenge is keeping those networks up while the foe tries to jam, degrade or destroy them.

“We’re trying to create a modern Marine Corps,” Neller said. “The stuff we have we take good care of, but there are Marines over here wrenching on vehicles older than they are.”

Watching an increasingly wealthy Beijing build increasingly sophisticated warships, aircraft and missiles, Richardson said the Pentagon needs to reform the procurement process so that the Navy can more quickly and cheaply deploy vessels.

To contain costs, those ships need smaller crews but can make up the difference with better automated systems, sensors and weapons packing a more powerful punch from longer distances, he added.

They’ll be helped by underwater and aerial drones, plus new directed energy weapons like lasers, he said, but Congress also has mandated a 355-ship Navy.Today he can deploy 280. The problem is America’s industrial base. Shipbuilding capacity today is a third of what the Navy could get in 1955.

“There are 14 shipyards that build ships that shuttered or got out of the defense business,” Richardson said. “So you can see these two conflicting trends — the need to grow the number of ships and yet we just don’t have the industrial capacity to do it.”

Evidence from communications intercepts has pointed to Moscow’s involvement during the investigation involving the FBI, CIA and other agencies, NBC reported, citing three unidentified U.S. officials and two other people briefed on the probe.

The evidence, however, is not conclusive enough for the United States to assign blame publicly to Moscow, according to the NBC report.

The FBI said it did not have a comment on the NBC report. A U.S. government source familiar with official assessments said intelligence agencies would not confirm the report.

U.S. officials said in July that they are still investigating health problems at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, and do not know who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses, which began in 2016 and have affected 26 Americans.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told Reuters on Tuesday, “We have made no determination on who or what is responsible for the health attacks.”

Symptoms have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with “mild traumatic brain injury,” State Department officials have said.

The State Department said in June it brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady resembling brain injury.

Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied involvement.

The United States believes sophisticated electromagnetic weapons may have been used on government workers, possibly in conjunction with other technologies, NBC reported.

The U.S. military has been trying to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, including by testing various devices on animals, NBC said, citing Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others.

Part of the work is being done at the directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves, NBC said."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is set to roll back the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s efforts to slow global warming, the Clean Power Plan that restricts greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.

A plan to be announced Tuesday would give states broad authority to determine how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. The Environmental Protect Agency announced late Monday that acting administrator Andrew Wheeler planned to brief the news media by telephone Tuesday on what the administration is calling the “Affordable Clean Energy” rule — greenhouse guidelines for states to set performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

The plan is also expected to let states relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades, according to a summary of the plan and several people familiar with the full proposal who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the plan publicly.

Combined with a planned rollback of car-mileage standards, the plan represents a significant retreat from Obama-era efforts to fight climate change and would stall an Obama-era push to shift away from coal and toward less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience.

A three-page summary being circulated at the White House focuses on boosting efficiency at coal-fired power plants and allowing states to reduce “wasteful compliance costs” while focusing on improved environmental outcomes. Critics say focusing on improved efficiency would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

The White House rejects that criticism.

“Carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector will continue to fall under this rule, but this will happen legally and with proper respect for the states, unlike” the Clean Power Plan, the summary says. The AP obtained a copy of the summary, which asserts that the Obama-era plan exceeds the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.

Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama.

“This is really a plan to prop up coal plants — or try to,” said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The Trump plan “will make no meaningful reductions” in greenhouse gas emissions “and it probably will make emissions worse,” Doniger said.

Gina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator when the Clean Power Plan was created in 2015, said that based on draft proposals and news reports, she expects the plan will not set specific federal targets for reducing emissions from coal-fired plants. The plan is expected to address power plants individually rather than across the electric grid as the EPA proposed under Obama. The new plan would give utilities and states more flexibility in achieving emissions reductions, but critics say it could harm public health.

‘Truth isn’t truth’: What Rudy Giuliani says he meant “They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” McCarthy said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.”

Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements.

“We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said.

3568483,"As investigators conduct a painstaking probe for the causes of California’s devastating wildfires, conspiracists have spawned their own theory: ignition by a secret cabal of nefarious “internationalists,” including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sergey Brin, who seek to run the world.

“There are hidden powers behind these calculated strikes in California,” warns one YouTube video, titled “An Open Letter To the People of California.”

In Facebook forums, YouTube videos and Reddit threads amassing tens of thousands of views, believers swap manipulated images of “light pillars” from the sky — proof, they say, that rural homes were targeted to burn, forcing residents into cities, where they can be more easily controlled by shadowy forces scheming at oppression.

People have long reached for far-flung theories to explain shocking calamities, such as the mysterious “grassy knoll” assassin of President John F. Kennedy and the U.S. government’s complicity in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.

Psychologists say these theories gain traction during times of trauma because they ease uncertainty, provide a platform for personal grievances and focus blame on an outside group — usually a network of “elites.” Suspicions are cradled by the internet, which allows people who share those thoughts to more easily connect.

“Whether it’s wildfires, contamination of water supply or some ‘deep state’ takeover — all these beliefs satisfy the need to make sense of a threatening and anxious world,” said psychologist Joseph A. Vitriol, a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University.

There’s a new high-tech twist to the perceived plots behind California’s recent Paradise, Woolsey and Wine Country fires. Asserting that nature could never incite a fire so fast or hot, some conspiracists say images of the light pillars reveal “directed energy weaponry” that emits highly focused heat. Others say fires were ignited by drones or satellite-based lasers.

While believers are split over the precise contours of the conspiracy, they agree that “geoengineering” is behind California’s parched and flammable landscape. The state’s weather is being deliberately altered, they allege. Then aircraft dump “chemtrails” of drying agents, which are easily ignited. Chemtrails are actually streaks of harmless condensation in the sky.

Who’s behind this complex scheme? Conspiracy websites such as Infowars, run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones, claim it is a secret plot by the moneyed elite to make certain parts of the country off-limits to human use and impose control.

Widely shared maps titled “Wildfires line up EXACTLY in the same path as the California High Speed Rail System” offer evidence, the conspiracists claim, that the fires are a plot to move people out of the way for construction of the transit system, key to eventual state takeover.

(The made-up fire maps’ geography is off, showing that San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Francisco and Sacramento were consumed by flames. Nor does the map line up with the train’s proposed route.)

Critics say social media companies have not stopped conspiracy theories from blossoming on their platforms. YouTube says it is committed to tackling misinformation, Facebook removed accounts that engage in “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” and Reddit banned a subreddit devoted to conspiracy theories, but sites continue to host false narratives about the fires in California.

Meanwhile, teams of highly skilled Cal Fire investigators are scouring the rugged terrain of Butte and Los Angeles counties for scientific clues to the fires — evidence that could someday aid prevention. The truth is climate change and poor forest management set the stage for these disasters, say scientists.

But that hasn’t stopped the theorists.

Former Petaluma fire Captain John Lord, who now lives in Lakeport, called the fires an “unnatural phenomenon.”

“The rate of spread is abnormally fast. … In a normal structural fire, there will always be things that are left — porcelain toilets, tiles, washers and dryers. In these fires, everything is gone,” he said.

“Planes released nanoparticles of metals, such as aluminum, into the atmosphere,” he said. “That is a drying agent, and highly combustible.”

On YouTube, a Paradise resident identified only as Cheryl described seeing “a huge corporate helicopter circling over my house … surveying the town, getting ready to grasp it.”

“The abundance of photographic and video evidence of so-called fire damage to both vehicles and structures in clear and conclusive. These November 2018 wildfires were not responsible for some ofthe most catastrophic destruction,” wrote Michael Thomas, editor of State of the Nation: Alternative News, Analysis and Commentary.

To be sure, some conspiracies turned out to be real. Watergate happened. So did the Iran-Contra affair. Unbelievably, the Russian government meddled in our 2016 U.S. presidential election.

But the creatively conspiratorial, if crazy, theories hold special appeal because fires can be mysterious, said psychology professor David Ludden of Georgia Gwinnett College, who studies conspiracies.

PG&E issues report explaining why it didn’t shut down power before Camp Fire “And they fit in with an existing world view that we can’t trust the government, that all these nefarious agencies are out there trying to get us,” he said. Internet sharing “creates a sense of security and superiority, of having inside knowledge that others don’t.”

Such thinking can distract the public from learning the objective reality of wildfires, making it more difficult to reduce risk, said Harvard’s Vitriol.

“It’s not just your crazy uncle in a tin foil hat, ruminating about the government,” he said. If the internet gives these ideas traction, “they spread and gain legitimacy, so they’re harder to combat.”"

She says people`s needs to talk about the movie`s ending is ""misdirected"" energy, and stems from the lack of control they feel about the world. This is something they feel they can control.

""So when it comes to signing petitions to reshoot the last season of a very popular TV show, or whether it`s spoiling a goddamn Christmas rom-com, people are able to do something about that,"" Clarke said.

There`s at least one person not interested in seeing Paul Feig`s holiday-themed romantic comedy ""Last Christmas"" spoiled all over the internet: star Emilia Clarke.

When trailers for the new film arrived in mid-August, social media users and entertainment journalists alike picked up on more than a few hints that not everything was as it seemed to be in the film, which sees Clarke playing a prickly Londoner who is pursued by a handsome (and slightly odd) stranger in the form of Henry Golding.

Outlets published entire screeds attempting to unpack what was really happening in the Emma Thompson-scripted film and Twitter lit up with entertainment obsessives casting about their own theories about a possible twist.

Clarke, for one, wishes people weren`t trying so hard to read into it, at least based on just a trailer or two. Asked in a recent interview with IndieWire how she feels about the weeks-long spoiler-guessing unfurling on social media, and the actress with succinct.

""It`s bloody annoying. Frustrating,"" Clarke said. ""It`s more complicated than people are guessing.""

And, yes, while the film does indeed pack a twist, Clarke believes it`s far more nuanced than people are expecting.

Written by Thompson (who also appears in the film as Clarke`s character`s mother) and first-time screenwriter Bryony Kimmings, the initial idea sprung from a concept developed by Thompson and her husband Greg Wise. And it`s one they spent some time refining.

""Emma and Greg wrote this script together, but they sent the script to all of their friends and it was only ready when their friends didn`t see the twist coming and couldn`t guess until it happens, so that`s where it comes from,"" Clarke said. ""It`s just frustrating.""

Ex-""Game of Thrones"" actress Emilia Clarke stars as Kate in ""Last Christmas."" Universal

It`s hardly the first time Clarke has dealt with fans turning to social media to spout off about her projects. After the series finale of her popular HBO series ""Game of Thrones,"" displeased fans took to the internet to launch an online petition that urged series creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss to remake the final six episodes, many of which divided ""Thrones"" fans around the world.

The series` penultimate episode, ""The Bells,"" proved to be one of its most divisive, thanks to a twist in which Clarke`s Daenerys Targaryen went full Mad Queen and burned King`s Landing to the ground.

""I`m careful with what the way that I`m wording this, but it`s no surprise, it`s common knowledge that the state of our world at the moment is scared and confused and there`s a lot of stuff going on that`s completely out of our control,"" Clarke said.

As frustrating as it might be, Clarke is introspective about what`s really going on with our current spoiler culture.

""That`s something within their own control, unlike the rather turbulent political environment that we seem to be living in,"" she said. ""Our world`s literally on fire, so I think that there`s a lot of things outside of people`s control, so when it comes to this kind of stuff, they can do something with it and want to.

1153795,"The Office of Naval Research’s much-hyped electromagnetic railgun prototype is finally capable of flexing its futuristic muscles.

After more than a decade of research and development and more than more than $500 million it will likely never see combat.

The electromagnetic railgun could land in a “valley of death” between R&D and procurement.



It can fire a solid metal slug at speeds of up to 4,500 mph, or Mach 6. It can hit targets up to 100 nautical miles away. It’s capable of defeating incoming ballistic missiles and liquefying even the most durable enemy armor, the equivalent of a weaponized meteor strike fired from the world’s most powerful gun.

After more than a decade of research and development and more than more than $500 million, the Office of Naval Research’s much-hyped electromagnetic railgun prototype is finally capable of flexing its futuristic muscles — but despite the swirl of science-fiction excitement surrounding the muscular new cannon, it will likely never see combat, Task & Purpose has learned.



According to interviews with several congressional and military sources, the much-hyped supergun has come under scrutiny from lawmakers and military planners thanks to the Strategic Capabilities Office, the once-classified department created in 2012 to fast-track new tech languishing in the DoD’s sprawling bureaucracy, and develop, as then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter once put it, “game-changing capabilities to confound potential enemies.”

With SCO’s interest drawn to other weapons systems, ONR may end up without the necessary funding to push the exceedingly complex railgun toward a critical testing milestone — a delay that, with increasing budget pressures and the DoD’s shifting strategic priorities, could condemn the decade-long project to an inescapable limbo of research and tinkering far from any ship.

‘They’re simply not buying it’

Over the last decade, the Pentagon has funneled money into the development of several next-generation, directed-energy weapons through the Navy’s Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations: The electromagnetic railgun, which has been in development since 2005 in conjunction with defense contractors General Atomics and BAE Systems; the hypervelocity projectile (HVP), a super dense, low-drag tungsten projectile designed as specialized ammo for the railgun; and solid-state lasers, long-time fixations of every service branch and a near-term short-range missile defense for surface vessels.

As of a Nov. 30 Congressional Research Service update , electromagnetic railgun research was progressing in line with the ONR roadmap that once envisioned installing the co mpleted weapon on a destroyer like the USS Zumwalt by the mid-2020s.

In recent years, however, SCO has turned its attention to the HVP: once developed explicitly for the railgun, the super-dense shell’s compatibility with conventional powder artillery, offering a cheaper and less technically complex alternative to the Pentagon’s incomplete supergun for not just the Navy, but the Army to rapidly equip.

“SCO shifted the project’s focus to conventional powder guns, facilitating a faster transition of HVP technology to the warfighter,” SCO spokesman Chris Sherwood told Task & Purpose.

“Our priority continues to be the HVP, which is reflected in the program’s budget.”

Researchers and policymakers confident on the system’s potential now fear that the reallocation of railgun funding at SCO’s behest will end up forestalling the successful installation and demonstration of a tactical rig aboard a naval vessel.

According to multiple legislative and military sources, insufficient funding for the railgun in the current defense budget will grind any meaningful progress to a halt, condemning efforts to R&D purgatory.

As one defense contractor with direct knowledge of the project recently told Task & Purpose, underfunding railgun now would effectively render the decade-long supergun project “dead in the water” by 2019.

“People at SCO don’t want to fund the railgun because they’re simply not buying it,” one senior legislative official with direct knowledge of the project told Task & Purpose. “They are imparting that priority on to Big Navy, which is pulling the money away from ONR.”

One last push

In the year since publishing the jaw-dropping footage of a tactical electromagnetic railgun demonstrator at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division’s Terminal Range in Virginia in November 2016, ONR has been working diligently alongside defense contractors BAE System and General Atomics to bring the supergun closer to combat readiness.

A second video released in July showed the rig firing off multi-shot salvos on Dahlgren’s 25-mile Potomac River test range. Through massive, repeated pulses of energy over a short period with minimal cooldown time, the railgun managed to fire 4.8 shells a minute, inching closer to the requirements laid out by Naval Sea Systems Command in a 2013 call for demonstrators that could fire 10 shells a minute and store up to 650 shells.



While ONR’s rep-rate demonstrations at Dahlgren represent a major leap forward for the railgun, the system still faces major technical hurdles that make the HVP a relatively inexpensive alternative.

Generating the electromagnetic fields necessary to accelerate a shell to tank-liquefying velocities without chemical propellants requires an energy farm or capacitor base significantly larger than what most Navy surface vessels can generate currently.

Next-generation “ electric warships ” like the Zumwalt can channel 78 megawatts from their generators through its power-distribution network, making them ideal for all manner of directed-energy weapons, but other surface vessels would require a major overhaul of their electrical infrastructure for the “pulsed-power architecture” required for multi-shot salvos.

The crucial railgun component that may threaten the entire effort is the “common mount.” A universal system for equipping sea or land-based platforms with a mass-produced tactical electromagnetic railgun, a 2016 House Armed Services Committee report noted that lawmakers were increasingly worried that SCO’s newfound HVP fetish “[had] left the Navy with a funding gap in developing the requirements and design for a common mount, which is a necessary prerequisite to getting this capability into operational use.” No mount, no tactical demonstrations — and, in turn, no railgun.

Without actually mounting a working demonstrator on a surface vessel, sources say, the electromagnetic railgun could land in a “valley of death” between R&D and procurement that may prevent the ambitious, decade-long project from ever going to war.

As with most technological moonshots, success and failure are a matter of optics: If the ONR can’t show off something with a Tony Stark-level “wow” factor for the military planners and lawmakers who pull ONR’s purse strings, researchers risk letter their political capital on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon E-ring slip away.

“Promising technologies fall into the ‘valley of death’ all the time,” a legislative source told Task & Purpose. “Testing is great, but unless you want to put money into transitioning that tech into an actual weapons system then what the hell are you doing? We’re afraid to take a risk and try to get things moving.”

The railgun’s advocates know the supergun is in trouble. In July, Rep. Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and co-chair of the Congressional Directed Energy Caucus, recommended an additional $26.4 million SCO outlays in the House Armed Service Committee’s version of the 2018 defense budget explicitly earmarked as “transition funding” for a shipboard tactical railgun demonstrator program, the second legislative boost to the project alongside an additional $15 million added to the Innovative Naval Prototypes line item by the Senate, according to an amendment justification obtained by Task & Purpose.

According to the Navy’s 2017 strategic program guide, the bulk of the appropriations already designated under that item line are for developing the thermal-management techniques that both the launcher and pulsed-power architecture require for that target sustained firing rate of 10 shells a minute.

The three-month continuing resolution passed in September offered a brief reprieve for advocates to make the case for an additional millions in transition funding to achieve a successful shipboard demonstration, and as of late November, lawmakers had authorized just $15 million of Langevin’s $26 million railgun amendment, funding the congressman told Task & Purpose would likely boost R&D efforts on the common mount.

“Our Navy must be given the ability to test this weapon’s lethality, range, and power at scale, and it must continue to develop the common mount prototype to take this technology to the next level for a shipboard demonstration,” Langevin told Task & Purpose.

But even though the NDAA is now in President Trump’s hands, the coming appropriations fight looming represents yet another uphill battle for the railgun program, putting ONR researchers who have devoted a decade to the project “in a constant state of stress,” as one legislative source put it.

“We’ll take it,” they told Task & Purpose of the $15 million approved by Congress, “but nobody has any idea what will happen after Dec. 8.”

Changing priorities

Despite the pleas of devoted researchers and congressional allies, the electromagnetic railgun will live and die at the whims of high-level decision-makers at the Department of Defense.

According to legislative and military sources, the legislative uncertainty and ONR’s resulting year-long charm offensive surrounding the supergun are shaped by changing strategic priorities within SCO, which wields considerable clout when it comes to developing next-generation weapons systems.

In 2015, SCO realized that the HVP, originally conceived as a specialized shell of the railgun, was just as effective when fired from a conventional powder cannons like the Army’s 105mm and 155mm M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers and the Navy’s deck-mounted Mk 45 5-inch guns.

A May 2016 report from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment found that large caliber guns could fire an HVP between 10 and 30 nautical miles at Mach 3, faster than conventional unguided rounds.

“We thought railguns were something we were really going to go after,” then-Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work stated at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C. in May 2016. “But it turns out that powder guns firing the same hypervelocity projectiles gets you almost as much as you would get out of the electromagnetic rail gun, but it’s something we can do much faster.”

The potential for rapid fielding across both the Army and Navy proved an alluring prospect for SCO’s mission, one that trumped the railgun’s hype.

When asked about the organization’s priorities, SCO spokesman Chris Sherwood confirmed to Task & Purpose that the office is focused on “developing the [HVP] for use in existing powder gun systems to give the Navy and Army near-term, cost-effective long-range fires and missile defense solutions.” Translation: Why invest in an expensive gun if the bullet alone can get the job done?

SCO has publically emphasize that it’s not abandoning the electromagnetic railgun outright. SCO chief William Roper insisted during a July 2016 conference that months after Work’s dismissal of the railgun, the new focus on the HVP would not jeopardize ONR’s work on the fearsome cannon.

“[It’s] not that we’re not interested in railgun — we are,” he said. “But if you look at the delta between fielding in quantity — we have [more than] a 1,000 powder guns, we have very few railguns.”

But according to military and legislative sources, SCO already squandered a shot at helping ONR achieve its critical shipboard installation milestone. In the internal justification memo obtained by Task & Purpose, Rep. Langevin’s office attributed the cut to transition funding under the 2017 defense budget to SCO, “[the] initial entity responsible for work done on the railgun mount, which they subsequently never undertook, leaving the responsibility to the Navy.”

Budget crunch

The problem of transition funding facing the electromagnetic railgun isn’t totally unique. Congressional budget anxieties frequently kill ambitious weapons development projects; consider the 7.62mm Interim Combat Service Rifle, the extra-lethal combat rifle solicited by the Army to defeat enemy body armor that ended up dead on the vine .

As one congressional source put it, “the greater question of uncertainty is: Just how much priority will the Navy and DoD give on the railgun in the coming years?”

An analysis of the Navy’s 2018 RDT&E funding request by Task & Purpose reveals significant changes in the line items that govern directed-energy systems. Appropriations for Power Projection Applied Research fell from $88.94 million in FY 2016 to $13.6 million in FY 2018 due to a reallocation of funding from railgun barrel testing; similarly, appropriation for Future Naval Capabilities Advanced Technology Development fell from $251.17 million in FY 2016 to $205.6 million, although this was partially due to the ramp-down of additional HVP research & development under that specific line item.

This isn’t to say the railgun is now completely without funding — Congress appears poised to fund a new Innovative Naval Prototypes line item to the tune of $163.1 million for a demonstrator, but the shifting funds reflect the SCO’s desire to separate the HVP from ONR’s existing suite of directed-energy programs.

“Money is being put into HVP, and not railgun projects, which is why the two are being split,” as one senior legislative official told Task & Purpose. “We’ve been able to rescue some of this funding, but Big Navy sees different opportunities, and because [the railgun] is a major challenge, they don’t want to explore it.”

As far as the Navy is concerned, the focus has remained on the core of the railgun project: the pure science and research that could, in time, put the futuristic weapons of tomorrow within the Pentagon’s grasp.



“ONR’s intention is to continue working on the system, continuing to maturing the components, and moving towards demonstrating a full-scale 32 megajoule launcher and pulsed power system capable of high repetition firing,” ONR spokesman David Smalley told Task & Purpose, declining to comment on funding decisions. “The S&T has continued to make great technical progress and there have been no show stoppers to date to prevent the Navy from having a railgun in the future.”"
2724178,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take emergency steps to keep coal and nuclear power plants running, the White House said Friday, in what would amount to an unprecedented intervention in U.S. power markets.

The White House billed the effort as a way to shore up national energy security, but the announcement triggered swift backlash from an unusual alliance of drillers, renewable energy producers and environmentalists who called it an unfair attempt to prop up non-competitive industries.

“Unfortunately, impending retirements of fuel-secure power facilities are leading to a rapid depletion of a critical part of our nation’s energy mix, and impacting the resilience of our power grid,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement about the measure.

Since campaigning for the White House, Trump has vowed to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry. Both the U.S. coal and nuclear power industries have been shrinking for years, under pressure from cheaper natural gas along with advances in solar and wind energy.

As part of the plan, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) could exercise emergency authority under national security laws to direct the operators to buy electricity from coal and nuclear facilities, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters. (bit.ly/2LPCTp3)

Details of the memo, dated May 29 and circulated ahead of a National Security Council meeting on the subject on Friday, were first reported by Bloomberg News late on Thursday.

Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a major coal-mining state, on Friday praised Trump for carrying out what he said was his idea: “I am glad President Trump and his Administration are considering my idea to use the Defense Production Act to save coal-fired power plants with emissions controls and protect our national security,” Manchin said.

The Defense Production Act, adopted in 1950 at the start of the Korean War, allows the federal government to intervene in business to promote national security.

A coalition of oil, gas, solar, wind and energy efficiency trade groups, however, on Friday released joint statements on the move, calling the proposed action “misguided.”

“We strongly urge the administration to reject this ill-conceived draft plan and adopt a policy approach that promotes market forces and competition in our nation’s power system,” Todd Snitchler, director of market development at the American Petroleum Institute, said.

The administration has said it is concerned the retirement of old coal and nuclear plants could put U.S. power supplies at risk because - unlike solar, wind, and natural gas power facilities - coal and nuclear generators can store fuel on site.

But federal energy regulators have rejected that argument and turned down a proposal late last year from Perry to subsidize nuclear and coal plants for providing “resilience” to the grid.

That did not stop the coal industry from making new requests for help from the administration. In late March, FirstEnergy’s (FE.N) FirstEnergy Solutions [FE.UL] unit - which runs coal and nuclear power units - called on the U.S. energy secretary to use the emergency powers to lift the sectors.

Coal company CEO Robert Murray of Murray Energy [MUYEY.UL], also called for Perry to use emergency powers to save at-risk coal plants.

Analysts said the new plan would face numerous legal and political challenges before it could get implemented.

“While we believe DOE has broad privileges to identify threats to national security, we are skeptical that (the order) entitles DOE to direct power market operators (...) to pay generators more based upon that threat,” said Katie Bays, energy analyst at Height Capital Markets in Washington.

“Litigation would begin almost immediately,” she said.

Earlier this year, east coast grid operator PJM, which serves 65 million customers, published an analysis of recently announced planned deactivations of certain nuclear plants and determined that there was no immediate threat to system reliability. “There is no need for any such drastic action,” said a PJM spokesperson about the new idea."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is set to roll back the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s efforts to slow global warming, the Clean Power Plan that restricts greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.

A plan to be announced Tuesday would give states broad authority to determine how to restrict carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. The Environmental Protect Agency announced late Monday that acting administrator Andrew Wheeler planned to brief the news media by telephone Tuesday on what the administration is calling the “Affordable Clean Energy” rule — greenhouse guidelines for states to set performance standards for existing coal-fired power plants.

Start your day with the news you need from the Bay Area and beyond. Sign up for our Morning Report weekday newsletter.

President Donald Trump is expected to promote the new plan at an appearance in West Virginia on Tuesday.

The plan is also expected to let states relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades, according to a summary of the plan and several people familiar with the full proposal who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the plan publicly.

Combined with a planned rollback of car-mileage standards, the plan represents a significant retreat from Obama-era efforts to fight climate change and would stall an Obama-era push to shift away from coal and toward less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas, wind and solar power.

Trump has already vowed to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement as he pushes to revive the coal industry.

Trump also has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take steps to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, warning that impending retirements of “fuel-secure” power plants that rely on coal and nuclear power are harming the nation’s power grid and reducing its resilience.

A three-page summary being circulated at the White House focuses on boosting efficiency at coal-fired power plants and allowing states to reduce “wasteful compliance costs” while focusing on improved environmental outcomes. Critics say focusing on improved efficiency would allow utilities to run older, dirtier power plants more often, undercutting potential environmental benefits.

The White House rejects that criticism.

“Carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector will continue to fall under this rule, but this will happen legally and with proper respect for the states, unlike” the Clean Power Plan, the summary says. The AP obtained a copy of the summary, which asserts that the Obama-era plan exceeds the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.

Obama’s plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions.

The Supreme Court put the plan on hold in 2016 following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states, an order that remains in effect.

Even so, the Obama plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates that promote energy conservation.

Trump has vowed to end what Republicans call a “war on coal” waged by Obama.

“This is really a plan to prop up coal plants — or try to,” said David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

The Trump plan “will make no meaningful reductions” in greenhouse gas emissions “and it probably will make emissions worse,” Doniger said.

Gina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator when the Clean Power Plan was created in 2015, said that based on draft proposals and news reports, she expects the plan will not set specific federal targets for reducing emissions from coal-fired plants. The plan is expected to address power plants individually rather than across the electric grid as the EPA proposed under Obama. The new plan would give utilities and states more flexibility in achieving emissions reductions, but critics say it could harm public health.

‘Truth isn’t truth’: What Rudy Giuliani says he meant “They are continuing to play to their base and following industry’s lead,” McCarthy said of the Trump administration and its new acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist. “This is all about coal at all costs.”

Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a trade group that represents coal producers, called the new rule a marked departure from the “gross overreach” of the Obama administration and said it should prevent a host of premature coal-plant retirements.

“We agree with those policymakers who have become increasingly concerned that coal retirements are a threat to grid resilience and national security,” she said.

2930882,"China and Russia are likely building high-powered lasers that can shoot down US satellites, according to a new Pentagon report.

Both countries are developing an arsenal of anti-satellite weaponry including missiles, cyber attacks, and ""directed energy weapons,"" according to the US Defense Intelligence Agency.

On Monday, the agency released an unclassified report on the security threat to the US`s dominance in space. It calls out both China and Russia as two countries with the technological prowess to take down US communication and navigational satellites, which could cause mayhem for businesses and the military.

The threat may sound far-fetched. But not to the Pentagon; the agency`s report lays out all the different ways Beijing and Moscow could attack US satellites in order to win future wars.

China, for instance, is attempting to become a ""space power"" that`s focused on exploration and defense, according to the DIA. The agency goes on to claim that the Chinese military is probably attempting to build a laser weapon system that can ""disrupt, degrade, or damage,"" orbital satellites and the sensors they use.

""China likely will field a ground-based laser weapon that can counter low-orbit space-based sensors by 2020, and by the mid-to-late 2020s, it may field higher-power systems that extend the threat to the structures of non-optical satellites,"" the report claims.

Russia is also pursuing satellite-killing lasers, according to the DIA. But the danger isn`t simply contained to energy-based attacks. China and Russia are developing satellites that can inspect and repair other satellites in space, which ""could also be used to approach another country`s satellite and conduct an attack that results in temporary or permanent damage,"" the DIA warns.

President Trump last year announced plans for a Space Force, a new branch of the US armed forces charged with developing next-generation aerospace military technology and ""space warfighting"" tactics.

Monday`s report doesn`t mention how the US might fend off these threats. But it`s no secret that we`ve long had an interest in laser weaponry as well. In recent years, the US military has been testing prototypes on Navy ships and for use on aircraft.

China was quick to dismiss the DIA`s report. ""What is alarming and concerning is that the US has defined the outer space as combat territory, announcing to build a space troop, frequently conducting outer space military drills,"" said a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to CNN.

716758,"Breakthrough Listen, an initiative to find signs of intelligent life in the universe, has detected 15 brief but powerful radio pulses emanating from a mysterious and repeating source – FRB 121102 – far across the universe.

Fast radio bursts are brief, bright pulses of radio emission from distant but largely unknown sources, and FRB 121102 is the only one known to repeat: more than 150 high-energy bursts have been observed coming from the object, which was identified last year as a dwarf galaxy about 3 billion light years from Earth.

Possible explanations for the repeating bursts range from outbursts from rotating neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields – so-called magnetars – to a more speculative idea: They are directed energy sources, powerful laser bursts used by extraterrestrial civilizations to power spacecraft, akin to Breakthrough Starshot’s plan to use powerful laser pulses to propel nano-spacecraft to our solar system’s nearest star, Proxima Centauri.

“Bursts from this source have never been seen at this high a frequency,” said Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and of the Breakthrough Listen program.

As astronomers around the globe try to understand the mechanism generating fast radio bursts, they have repeatedly turned their radio telescopes on FRB 121102. Siemion and his team alerted the astronomical community to the high-frequency activity via an Astronomer’s Telegram on Monday evening, Aug. 28.

“As well as confirming that the source is in a newly active state, the high resolution of the data obtained by the Listen instrument will allow measurement of the properties of these mysterious bursts at a higher precision than ever possible before,” said Breakthrough Listen postdoctoral researcher Vishal Gajjar, who discovered the increased activity.

First detected with the Parkes Telescope in Australia, fast radio bursts have now been seen by several radio telescopes around the world. FRB 121102 was discovered on Nov. 2, 2012, (hence its name) and in 2015 it was the first fast radio burst seen to repeat, ruling out theories of bursts’ origins that involved the catastrophic destruction of the progenitor, at least in this instance.

Regardless of FRB 121102’s ultimate source, when the recently detected pulses left their host galaxy, our solar system was less than 2 billion years old, noted Steve Croft, a Breakthrough Listen astronomer at UC Berkeley. Life on Earth consisted only of single-celled organisms; it would be another billion years before even the simplest multi-cellular life began to evolve.

As part of Breakthrough Listen’s program to observe nearby stars and galaxies for signatures of extraterrestrial technology, the project science team at UC Berkeley added FRB 121102 to its list of targets. In the early hours of Saturday, Aug. 26, Gajjar observed that area of the sky using the Breakthrough Listen backend instrument at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.

The instrument accumulated 400 terabytes (a million million bytes) of data over a five-hour period, observing across the entire 4 to 8 GHz frequency band. This large dataset was searched for signatures of short pulses from the source over a broad range of frequencies, with a characteristic dispersion, or delay as a function of frequency, caused by the presence of gas in space between Earth and the source. The distinctive shape that the dispersion imposes on the initial pulse is an indicator of the amount of material between us and the source, and hence an indicator of the distance to the host galaxy.

Analysis by Gajjar and the Breakthrough Listen team revealed 15 new pulses from FRB 121102. The observations show for the first time that fast radio bursts emit at higher frequencies than previously observed, with the brightest emission occurring at around 7 GHz.

“The extraordinary capabilities of the backend receiver, which is able to record several gigahertz of bandwidth at a time, split into billions of individual channels, enable a new view of the frequency spectrum of FRBs, and should shed additional light on the processes giving rise to FRB emission.” Gajjar said.

“Whether or not fast radio bursts turn out to be signatures of extraterrestrial technology, Breakthrough Listen is helping to push the frontiers of a new and rapidly growing area of our understanding of the universe around us,” Siemion said."

China’s military is well on its way to besting the US’s technologic edge, due to rapid economic and military development.

By stealing already-extant weapons technology, China is developing advanced weapons at a rapid pace. It’s also figuring out how to disrupt the US’s battlefield systems, working on long-range weapons, and leading the way on artificial intelligence.

China’s military power is quickly becoming the greatest threat to US military primacy. From posturing in the South China Sea to damaging hacking campaigns, the Chinese government is investing more time and resources into its military strategy, and it shows.

A June report from the Centre for a New American Security, co-authored by former Deputy Secretary of Defence Robert O. Work, outlines the ways China’s strategy and technology threaten to best the US in a great power struggle – and what the US can do to maintain its military primacy.

By employing cyber attacks and hacking to steal US military technology, China is circumventing the long, painstaking research and development phase of weapons manufacturing.

In January and February of 2018, hackers working for the Chinese government were able to steal 614 gigabytes of information from a military contractor about a secretive US Navy project called Sea Dragon, intended to upgrade and improve current US weapons systems by introducing a “disruptive offensive capability,” The Washington Post reported.

There are many other known instances of Chinese security breaches; and even at high levels of classification and security, the US government has difficulty controlling the intrusions.

2. China is breaking down US systems.

China also works to break down US battlefield defences. The US high-technology battlefield system – the so-called “kill chain” – is comprised of four grids that, working in concert, “find, fix, and finish intended targets,” according to the report.

The battlefield grids have to communicate with each other – and that’s where China’s strategy is focused on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities to jam the communication system, degrading an adversary’s ability to strike in concert and, hopefully, make those strikes less effective.

3. Strike early, strike hard.

Reuters A member of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) coastal defence force jumps through a burning obstacle during a drill to mark the 87th Army Day at a military base in Qingdao, Shandong province July 29, 2014.

China’s strategy to offset US dominance and gain tactical advantages also depends on its ability to strike early in a conflict, and strike hard. China’s focus on developing long-range ballistic and cruise missiles that match US weapons like the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM, which has a range of 100 nautical miles. In some cases, Chinese weapons outmatch US weapons ranges.

This strategy is cost-effective and exploits the US’s previous decision to forgo missiles with a range longer than 500 km under the recently-deceased INF treaty; the US tested its first post-INF range ground-launched missile on August 18. Plus, China can call massive mobile, land-based missile strikes with relative ease, exploiting the US’s dependence on air-based bombardments, which take longer to coordinate.

China has so focused on its missile strategy that it has created a branch of its military entirely devoted to it – the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF), which is now developing “some of the most advanced cruise and ballistic missiles of any force,” including hypersonic missiles and the DF-21D “carrier killer,” which has a nearly 1,000-mile range, according to the report.

4. China hides its hand.

All these so-called “offset” strategies include some element of capability concealment, to suprise adversaries during battle. The US calls these “black capabilities,” kept under lock and key by military and state apparatus. While China may show off some of its capabilities, like the “carrier-killer,” as a deterrent, it keeps what some observers call “Assassin’s Mace” or Project 995 weapons, secret.

Work speculates that these “black” capabilities might include “directed energy weapons, advanced space weapons, electromagnetic railguns, high-powered microwave weapons, or even more exotic arms.”

5. China leads in artificial intelligence.

China’s goverment notoriously uses artificial intelligence to track and control its population. It’s also betting that AI like autonomous unmanned systems, human-machine hybrid intelligence, automated decisionmaking, and intelligent robotics are the future both of economic advancement and warfighting, and it’s determined to come out on top.

China’s tactic of military and civil fusion also works here, as advancements in the civilian sector will be easily adapted to military capabilities.

China’s economy is the second-largest in the world, and it’s on the path to overtake the US’s in absolute GDP by 2030 – giving China the ability to spend far more resources on its military than in previous decades.

From 1996 to 2015, China increased its military spending by 620%.

What can the US do?

After decades of primacy and focusing on conflicts in the Middle East, the US is unprepared for the kind of power China is building. So what can the Defence Department do to improve its chances in a great power matchup with China? Work’s report proposes the following.

Study and expolit weaknesses in China’s strategy.

Weaken China’s confidence in their own ability to drive the narrative of conflict and weapons developments by showing our own military prowess and understanding of their strategy.

Ensure that US technology, strategy, doctrine, and organisations fit together seamlessly to achieve the US’s desired end state.

The US military “has a demonstrated ability to question the status quo, to take risks and experiment, and adopt new technologically enabled operational concepts that confound its opponents,” Work’s report observes.

“If it hopes to upset the Chinese offset, it will need to do so again.”

China also works to break down US battlefield defenses. The US high-technology battlefield system – the so-called “kill chain” – is comprised of four grids that, working in concert, “find, fix, and finish intended targets,” according to the report.

The battlefield grids have to communicate with each other – and that’s where China’s strategy is focused on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities to jam the communication system, degrading an adversary’s ability to strike in concert and, hopefully, make those strikes less effective.

3. Strike early, strike hard.

China’s strategy to offset US dominance and gain tactical advantages also depends on its ability to strike early in a conflict, and strike hard. China’s focus on developing long-range ballistic and cruise missiles that match US weapons like the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM, which has a range of 100 nautical miles. In some cases, Chinese weapons outmatch US weapons ranges.

This strategy is cost-effective and exploits the US’s previous decision to forgo missiles with a range longer than 500 km under the recently-deceased INF treaty; the US tested its first post-INF range ground-launched missile on August 18. Plus, China can call massive mobile, land-based missile strikes with relative ease, exploiting the US’s dependence on air-based bombardments, which take longer to coordinate.

China has so focused on its missile strategy that it has created a branch of its military entirely devoted to it – the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF), which is now developing “some of the most advanced cruise and ballistic missiles of any force,” including hypersonic missiles and the DF-21D “carrier killer,” which has a nearly 1,000-mile range, according to the report.

4. China hides its hand.

All these so-called “offset” strategies include some element of capability concealment, to suprise adversaries during battle. The US calls these “black capabilities,” kept under lock and key by military and state apparatus. While China may show off some of its capabilities, like the “carrier-killer,” as a deterrent, it keeps what some observers call “Assassin’s Mace” or Project 995 weapons, secret.

Work speculates that these “black” capabilities might include “directed energy weapons, advanced space weapons, electromagnetic railguns, high-powered microwave weapons, or even more exotic arms.”

5. China leads in artificial intelligence.

China’s goverment notoriously uses artificial intelligence to track and control its population. It’s also betting that AI like autonomous unmanned systems, human-machine hybrid intelligence, automated decisionmaking, and intelligent robotics are the future both of economic advancement and warfighting, and it’s determined to come out on top.

China’s tactic of military and civil fusion also works here, as advancements in the civilian sector will be easily adapted to military capabilities.

China’s economy is the second-largest in the world, and it’s on the path to overtake the US’s in absolute GDP by 2030 – giving China the ability to spend far more resources on its military than in previous decades.

From 1996 to 2015, China increased its military spending by 620%.

What can the US do?

After decades of primacy and focusing on conflicts in the Middle East, the US is unprepared for the kind of power China is building. So what can the Defense Department do to improve its chances in a great power matchup with China? Work’s report proposes the following.

Study and expolit weaknesses in China’s strategy.

Weaken China’s confidence in their own ability to drive the narrative of conflict and weapons developments by showing our own military prowess and understanding of their strategy.

Ensure that US technology, strategy, doctrine, and organizations fit together seamlessly to achieve the US’s desired end state.

The US military “has a demonstrated ability to question the status quo, to take risks and experiment, and adopt new technologically enabled operational concepts that confound its opponents,” Work’s report observes.

“If it hopes to upset the Chinese offset, it will need to do so again.”"

China’s military is well on its way to besting the US’s technologic edge, due to rapid economic and military development.

By stealing already-extant weapons technology, China is developing advanced weapons at a rapid pace. It’s also figuring out how to disrupt the US’s battlefield systems, working on long-range weapons, and leading the way on artificial intelligence.

China is also developing highly secretive weapons which might include, “directed energy weapons, advanced space weapons, electromagnetic railguns, high-powered microwave weapons, or even more exotic arms,” according to former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work.

China’s military power is quickly becoming the greatest threat to US military primacy. From posturing in the South China Sea to damaging hacking campaigns, the Chinese government is investing more time and resources into its military strategy, and it shows.

A June report from the Center for a New American Security, co-authored by former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work, outlines the ways China’s strategy and technology threaten to best the US in a great power struggle – and what the US can do to maintain its military primacy.

1. The Chinese government is hacking its way to new technology.

By employing cyber attacks and hacking to steal US military technology, China is circumventing the long, painstaking research and development phase of weapons manufacturing.

In January and February of 2018, hackers working for the Chinese government were able to steal 614 gigabytes of information from a military contractor about a secretive US Navy project called Sea Dragon, intended to upgrade and improve current US weapons systems by introducing a “disruptive offensive capability,” The Washington Post reported.

1546533,"San Diego hosts a rare gathering of the nation’s top military leaders.

The Chief of Naval Operations joined the commandants of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard in talking about the future of warfare.

Possible threats to America’s military superiority include rising Russia and China.

A generation of sailors and Marines who waged counterinsurgency wars overseas must adapt quickly to a changed world, where rising powers such as Russia and China threaten to usurp America’s once impervious military.

That was the urgent message delivered Thursday afternoon at San Diego’s convention center during a rare public gathering of three service leaders: Chief of Naval Operations John M. Richardson, Marine Corps commandant Gen. Robert Neller and Coast Guard commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft.

In an hourlong discussion moderated by retired Navy Adm. James G. Stavridis before a packed audience, they described the vital need for a steady funding stream to retrain and rearm services straining from nearly 17 years of constant counter-terror operations.

Hoping to avert another government shutdown, lawmakers on Capitol Hill struggled Thursday to pass a stop-gap spending measure along with a long-term budget that sends $165 billion to the Pentagon over the next two years and increased the federal debt more than $1 trillion.

Over the past decade, Congress paid the military’s bills with a series of continuing resolutions, with fewer funds for the services due to spending caps enacted in 2011’s so-called “sequestration” legislation.

“I’m hopeful that it’ll pass and it’s a lot of money,” Neller said. “But we’re going to get that money like we did last year, with about half the fiscal year left to spend it. That’s not any way to run a business.”

Although both he and Zukunft fretted about the national debt and its economic effects in coming years, Neller said that the influx of military spending was important to preserve the nation’s survival.

“The adversary out there is making big bets, big investments, in their capacity. And their capabilities have grown,” Neller said. “Whether they want to take us on or not, we have to be able to go and display the capability to deter them.”

Richardson said his top priority was revamping the Navy’s ballistic submarine fleet. The underwater Navy carries 70 percent of America’s nuclear warheads.

“Without that strategic deterrent, we’re really in a different world,” said Richardson, a career submariner and the former director of the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program. “Everything becomes impossibly harder. That’s got to succeed.”

Neller said the Navy needs more attack subs, too. The fleet is supposed to deploy 66 of them but today there are only 50 left, a number expected to fall to 43 before shipyards begin churning out two Virginia-class replacements annually in the next decade.

The silent hunters of the deep sail ahead of carrier and amphibious strike groups, sniffing out enemy subs and spying on a foe’s battle fleets.

“We need more attack submarines, OK? I need to get where I’m going,” Neller said.

“When was the last time we had to fight to get to the fight? We just went. We didn’t have to fight to get there,” he continued, pointing to the guerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“We’re going to have to fight to get to the fight.”

Once in the thick of battle, Neller will need newer aircraft, swapping out his aging fleet with fifth-generation jets, tilt-rotor vehicles and high-tech helicopters.

He also wants more reliable and resilient command and control systems. That’s the technology that helps Marines know where their units are in relation to the enemy, clearing the fog of war. The challenge is keeping those networks up while the foe tries to jam, degrade or destroy them.

“We’re trying to create a modern Marine Corps,” Neller said. “The stuff we have we take good care of, but there are Marines over here wrenching on vehicles older than they are.”

Watching an increasingly wealthy Beijing build increasingly sophisticated warships, aircraft and missiles, Richardson said the Pentagon needs to reform the procurement process so that the Navy can more quickly and cheaply deploy vessels.

To contain costs, those ships need smaller crews but can make up the difference with better automated systems, sensors and weapons packing a more powerful punch from longer distances, he added.

They’ll be helped by underwater and aerial drones, plus new directed energy weapons like lasers, he said, but Congress also has mandated a 355-ship Navy.Today he can deploy 280. The problem is America’s industrial base. Shipbuilding capacity today is a third of what the Navy could get in 1955.

“There are 14 shipyards that build ships that shuttered or got out of the defense business,” Richardson said. “So you can see these two conflicting trends — the need to grow the number of ships and yet we just don’t have the industrial capacity to do it.”

Although Zukunft is finally getting the first large icebreaker built for the Coast Guard in four decades, his aging fleet of patrol boats on inland waterways struggles to keep $4.6 trillion in American commerce flowing.

Modern replacements will cost more than $15 million each but the commandant needs them to cost less to maintain and fuel, saving money in the long run.

“Some are 73 years old now,” he said. “It’s not a huge ask but it’s a huge return on investment.”

2053863,"President Donald Trump ordered his energy secretary to take immediate action to stem power plant closures, arguing that a decline in coal and nuclear electricity is putting the nation’s security at risk.

“Impending retirements of fuel-secure power facilities are leading to a rapid depletion of a critical part of our nation’s energy mix and impacting the resilience of our power grid,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in an emailed statement Friday. Trump has directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry “to prepare immediate steps to stop the loss of these resources and looks forward to his recommendations.”

Trump’s directive comes as administration officials search for ways to extend the life of money-losing coal and nuclear power plants that face competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. The plants are considered “fuel-secure” because they house coal and nuclear material on site and are not dependent on pipelines that can be disrupted, wind that stops blowing or a sun that sets.

Coal producers rose on the news, with Peabody Energy Corp. climbing the most since Aug. 1, 2017 and closing up 4.8 percent to $45.35. Arch Coal Inc. rose 2 percent to $83.81. Consol Energy Inc. gained 3.7 percent to $45.70, while Alliance Resource Partners LP was up 1.3 percent to $19.50. The Stowe Global Coal Index was up 1 percent.

Administration officials are still weighing the best approach, Sanders said. The National Security Council was to meet Friday to discuss the Energy Department’s latest idea for shoring up the facilities.

The department’s strategy, outlined in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, would use authority granted under a pair of federal laws to establish a “strategic electric generation reserve” and compel grid operators to buy electricity from at-risk plants. The steps are necessary, the memo says, to protect national security.

The move comes as Trump uses similar national security arguments to justify market interventions aimed at protecting other treasured political constituencies -- steelworkers and automakers -- at the expense of U.S. allies.

“National security is being invoked by people who once favored markets,” observed John Shelk, president of Electric Power Supply Association, at a conference in New York. “Everybody loses in a fuels war.”

Two-Year Study

The draft plan is meant to buy time for a two-year study of vulnerabilities in the American energy delivery system, extending to natural gas pipelines as well as power plants. The agency argues that power plant closures must be managed for national security reasons, because nuclear and coal-fired facilities can easily be restored after extreme weather events, cyber-attacks and other emergencies.

Trump administration officials have already spent a year contemplating action. After the Energy Department conducted a study of grid reliability last year, Perry proposed a rule to compensate coal and nuclear plants. Federal regulators shot down the idea in January.

A FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary requested immediate intervention from Perry’s agency in late March, after the Ohio-based company announced it would shut three nuclear power plants feeding the nation’s largest grid, operated by PJM Interconnection LLC.

FirstEnergy Reaction

FirstEnergy President Charles Jones welcomed the administration’s announcement Friday.

“Baseload coal and nuclear plants help maintain electric system resiliency and national security while also playing an irreplaceable role in the regional economy,” Jones said in an emailed statement. “Preserving these vital facilities is the right thing to do for the industry, the electric grid and our customers.”

The move would represent the president’s most direct effort to bring back coal mining jobs and reward voters who helped put him into office, ahead of pivotal midterm elections that could decide whether Republicans retain control of the House and Senate.

Some 12,000 megawatts of coal-fired power are expected to retire this year, the National Mining Association said.

“Without action, we may pass a reliability and resiliency crisis point of no return,” the trade group said by email. “We need a plan to preserve the reliable, affordable energy that continues to slip away each day, and it is encouraging that this administration is taking the issue seriously.”

Opponents of the new proposal contend the intervention is a solution in search of a problem and that there are other ways to back up the grid.

The Real Barrier to Trump’s Coal Bailout? His Own Appointees

PJM Interconnection said in a statement that the power system is more reliable than ever.

“There is no need for any such drastic action,” the grid operator said. “Any federal intervention in the market to order customers to buy electricity from specific power plants would be damaging to the markets and therefore costly to consumers.”

The administration’s plans drew a swift rebuke from Trump allies in the oil and gas industry, aligning them with renewable power boosters also threatened by the action.

Todd Snitchler, the American Petroleum Institute’s market development group director, said a move to assist power plants “that are struggling to be profitable under the guise of national security would be unprecedented and misguided.”

Environmentalists vowed to file lawsuits combating any potential intervention, arguing it threatened to jeopardize progress in paring greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change.

“This is an outrageous ploy to force American taxpayers to bail out coal and nuclear executives who have made bad decisions by investing in dirty and dangerous energy resources,” said Mary Anne Hitt, director of Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. “It will be soundly defeated both in the courts and in the court of public opinion.”

Under the Energy Department’s draft plan, the administration would take action under two laws: the Federal Power Act that allows the government to guarantee profits for power plants amid grid emergencies, and the 68-year-old Defense Production Act, a Cold War-era statute once invoked by President Harry Truman to help the steel industry.

For two years, the Energy Department would direct the purchase of power or electric generation capacity from a designated list of facilities “to forestall any future actions toward retirement, decommissioning or deactivation,” according to the memo. The proposed Energy Department directive also would tell some of those facilities to continue generating and delivering electric power according to their existing or recent contracts with utilities.

It’s not clear that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would go along with the plan. Although the administration could aim to bypass the electric regulators completely, FERC could play a role in any effort to require grid operators to make out-of-market payments to electric generators.

“This might just never even be taken up by FERC,” said John Bartlett, co-portfolio manager of the Reaves Utilities ETF. “Job No. 1 if you’re a FERC commissioner is stay out of court.”

2065754,"Along with the sensors, the military is also rushing to equip troops to bring drones down. This summer, someone at the Marine Corps’ Fire Base Bell tweeted a picture of his Battelle DroneDefender, a directed-energy weapon that can disrupt a drone’s control link and GPS navigation at a distance of 400 meters. Battelle reports that they’ve sold more than a hundred to customers within the Pentagon, Department of Homeland Security, and militaries around the world, but getting them in the hands of the Peshmerga has been a challenge. Also, what works in the open desert — shooting electromagnetic energy at drones — may not work in a dense urban environment with lots of consumer electronics around. That could prove a problem when the fighting moves into Mosul.

Continued research into how to use directed energy to down rogue drones in dense cities is “a worthy investment,” said Shields.

“There’s a disciplined process to move through” to getting bomb-detection-and-defeat gear to the front lines, he said. In January and February, JIDO will test state-of-the-art tools for defeating UAVs.

In the weeks and months ahead, as the Iraqi Security Forces (backed up by U.S. special operators) attempt to take Mosul, Shields expects forces to face much bigger and more dangerous improvised explosive threats than bombs strapped to hobby drones. “ISIL does an incredibly good job of booby-trapping” houses, he said, noting lessons learned in Ramadi and Fallujah.

There’s also the threat of tunnel bombs. JIDO has a tool called a direct synthetic electromagnetic gradiometer: basically, a tunnel-finding radar that fits in a tube the size of a coffee Thermos for mounting under a medium-sized drone.

Nifty gadgets all. But, says Shields, “there’s no single technology that’s going to defeat” drone-borne bombs, much less elaborate house and tunnel bombs. Rather, it will be a combination of technology; intelligence collection from the field; and the tactics, techniques and procedures that the military creates as ISIS hurls dangerous new weapons at them.

“We’re developing the [tactics, techniques, and procedure] right now,” says Shields. “So the integration of technology, it’s happening right now.”

4219082,"Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said Wednesday that the ""the carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

He said the US carrier fleet — the most powerful naval force — is adapting to meet threats from rivals, such as China, that are openly talking about sinking them.

The admiral emphasized that carriers are hard to kill, calling them the ""most survivable airfield.""

US aircraft carriers are a ""tremendous expression of US national power,"" and that makes them a target for adversarial powers, the US Navy`s top admiral said Wednesday.

""The big thing that is occupying our minds right now is the advent of long-range precision weapons, whether those are land-based ballistic missiles, coastal-defense cruise missiles, you name it,"" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said at the Atlantic Council, adding that the systems wielded by adversaries are ""becoming more capable.""

Chinese media has recently been hyping its ""carrier-killer"" DF-26 ballistic missiles, which are reportedly able to hit targets as far as 3,500 miles away. China released footage of the Chinese military test-firing the missile last month.

The purpose is to send ""a clear message to the US about China`s growing missile capability, and that it can hold at risk US strategic assets, such as carriers and bases,"" Adam Ni, who researches China at Macquarie University in Sydney, recently told the South China Morning Post.

""There`s two sides, an offensive part and a defensive part,"" Richardson said Wednesday, stressing that the Navy`s carriers are adapting to the new threats. ""The advent of some of new technologies, particularly directed energy technologies coupled with the emerging power generation capabilities on carriers, is going to make them a much, much more difficult target to hit.""

Speaking with the crew of the new supercarrier USS Gerald R. Ford on Tuesday, Richardson said, ""You are going to be able to host a whole cadre of weapons that right now we can just start to dream about. We`re talking about electric weapons, high energy laser, high-powered microwave [and] very, very capable radars.""

The expensive $13 billion carrier is expected to be deployed in the next few years.

""Rather than expressing the carrier as uniquely vulnerable, I would say it is the most survivable airfield within the field of fire,"" Richardson said Wednesday in response to questions about carrier vulnerability. ""This is an airfield that can move 720 miles a day that has tremendous self-defense capabilities.""

""If you think about the sequence of events that has to emerge to be able to target and hit something that can move that much, and each step in that chain of events can be disrupted from the sensing part all the way back to the homing part, it’s the most survivable airfield in the area,"" he said.

Richardson said the carrier is less vulnerable now than at any time since World War II, when the US Navy was putting carriers in action, and those carriers were in combat taking hits. ""The carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

US carriers are particularly hard, albeit not impossible, to kill.

""Rather than expressing the carrier as uniquely vulnerable, I would say it is the most survivable airfield within the field of fire,"" Richardson said Wednesday in response to questions about carrier vulnerability. ""This is an airfield that can move 720 miles a day that has tremendous self-defense capabilities.""

""If you think about the sequence of events that has to emerge to be able to target and hit something that can move that much, and each step in that chain of events can be disrupted from the sensing part all the way back to the homing part, it’s the most survivable airfield in the area,"" he said.

Richardson said the carrier is less vulnerable now than at any time since World War II, when the US Navy was putting carriers in action, and those carriers were in combat taking hits. ""The carrier is going to be a viable force element for the foreseeable future.""

US carriers are particularly hard, albeit not impossible, to kill.

""It wouldn`t be impossible to hit an aircraft carrier, but unless they hit it with a nuke, an aircraft carrier should be able to take on substantial damage,"" retired Capt. Talbot Manvel, who served as an aircraft-carrier engineer and was involved in the design of the new Ford-class carriers, told Business Insider previously.

US carriers ""can take a lick and keep on ticking,"" he said."
5085415,"The US Army is turning up the power on its plans for a high-energy laser to shoot down everything from rockets and mortars to even ""more stressing threats,"" the service recently revealed.

The Army plans to field a 50-kilowatt laser on Stryker armored combat vehicles within the next few years to defend troops against enemy unmanned aerial systems, as well as rockets, artillery, and mortars. The Army has previously practiced shooting down drones with 5-kilowatt lasers.

The next step for the Army was to develop and deploy more powerful 100-kilowatt combat lasers on heavy trucks, but the Army has since changed its plans, deciding to instead pursue a 250-300 kilowatt laser, Breaking Defense reports.

Rather than develop the 100-kilowatt High Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator (HEL-TVD), the Army will instead on developing the more powerful directed energy weapon to support the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) aimed at countering cruise missiles.

The Army declined to clarify whether or not ""more stressing threats"" included cruise missiles, a growing threat facing American warfighters, but experts told Breaking Defense that 300 kilowatts was the threshold for shooting down cruise missiles.

The Strykers armed with 50-kilowatt lasers are expected to be fielded in 2022, and the more powerful HEL-IFPC is likely to be in the hands of US soldiers by 2024.

Directed-energy weapons are cost-effective alternatives to traditional air-and-missile defense capabilities.

""The advantage of the laser is that we have the ability to have an unlimited magazine when it comes to unmanned aerial systems, as well as rockets, artillery, mortars,"" Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski, the principal military deputy to the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, said last month.

""Where before we were shooting $100,000 missiles at $7,000 [Unmanned Aerial Systems]. This puts us in a position where we`re not spending that kind of money to do that. We`re taking those targets down in a much more rapid fashion and a much cheaper fashion.""

And, the Army isn`t the only service trying to develop combat lasers.

The Navy is planning to equip its Arleigh Burke-class destroyers with the 60-kilowatt High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance (HELIOS) system designed to target small attack boats and drones, and the Air Force is working on the Self-Protect High-Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) program to develop a weapon to counter surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles.
